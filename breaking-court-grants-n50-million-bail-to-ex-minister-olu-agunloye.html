They must possess properties valued at N300 million, with a verifiable Certificate of Occupancy.</p><p>Additionally, they are required to submit copies of their identification cards and photocopies of their international passports to the court.</p><p>The defendant must surrender his passport to the court and be present for all hearings.</p><p>The case has been adjourned until February 12.</p><p><strong>Naija News</strong> reports that the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (<strong>EFCC)</strong> is investigating Agunloye over the $6 billion Mambilla Hydropower Contract.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpkZH1ye5BqZpuqlZa4qrrGZpqoraKpeqi%2BwKerrGWean1uucilo6KnnmKvorXLZquoZZWteq61zaKqrZ2iYrytwYyanq6mnKTGpns%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SkyVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
