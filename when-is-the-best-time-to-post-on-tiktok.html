How many videos should you post every week? We break down what you need to know to find success on TikTok.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: TikTok/Instagram</a></figure><p>Newsflash: All the kids are on <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">TikTok</a>. The short video app that very closely resembles Vine has taken off with Gen Z, so that means we're about two months away from it being completely ruined by old people. Can't you just see it now? Your aunt Barbara singing you happy birthday in a TikTok video?</p><p>But for now, TikTok is still a mystery to many. In this article, we'll break down what you need to know about this wildly popular social media platform, including the best times to post, how much you should post, and <a href=#>how much money can actually make by being TikTok famous</a>.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">When is the best time to post on TikTok?</h2><p>While it’s important to know your audience and how to reach them, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Influencer Marketing Hub</a> has an extensive list on the best times to post on TikTok. According to the outlet, these times can range between the early morning and late evening, and include:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Monday:</strong> 6 a.m., 10 a.m., 10 p.m.</p></li><li><p><strong>Tuesday:</strong> 2 a.m., 4 a.m., 9 a.m.</p></li><li><p><strong>Wednesday:</strong> 7 a.m., 8 a.m., 11 p.m.</p></li><li><p><strong>Thursday: </strong>9 a.m., 12 a.m., 7 p.m.</p></li><li><p><strong>Friday:</strong> 5 a.m., 1 p.m., 3 p.m.</p></li><li><p><strong>Saturday: </strong>11 a.m., 7 p.m., 8 p.m.</p></li><li><p><strong>Sunday: </strong>7 a.m., 8 a.m., 4 p.m.</p></li></ul><p>If you're really serious about this, though, you can switch your TikTok to a "<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">pro account</a>," which will let you see your analytics. The next thing to determine is when your audience is awake and what their schedules are like. The vast majority of people on TikTok are young, between the ages of 18 and 34, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>according to one Quora user</strong></a>. Those people are most likely at work during the day and at home on their phones at night, so it's reasonable to conclude that the best time to post is during lunch hours, at night, or on weekends.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>That being said, posting at the "right time" isn't all you need for a successful TikTok presence. People like <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Brittany Broski</a> became a meme thanks to her reaction to trying kombucha in a TikTok video. Additionally, many aspiring stars like <a href=#>Tabitha Brown</a> used their skills and knowledge to build a solid fan base. After creating an account during the COVID-19 pandemic, Tabitha reached over 1 million followers who tuned into her vegan recipes and soothing, auntie-like advice.</p><p>Since rising to fame, Tabitha has landed acting roles, a New York Times bestselling book, and a Target clothing line. <a href=#>Addison Rae</a> went a similar route when her TikTok account exploded. In 2020, Addison booked a gig on the movie He’s All That, and is also <a href=#>close friends with Kourtney Kardashian</a>.</p><p>It's important to note that the content matters. Just like with any social media platform, you have to optimize your TikTok content as much as possible. In addition to the time you post, pay attention to trending hashtags and find the thing that makes you different.</p><p>It may sound like common sense, but in addition to releasing videos at the right times and using the right hashtags and engaging with people on the app, the more content you put out there, the more of a chance you have to make it big.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a title=@addisonre href=#>@addisonre</a> <a title="♬ cool kids - 3" href=#>♬ cool kids - &lt;3</a></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">How often should you post videos on TikTok?</h2><p>In order to get more fans and likes, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">TikTok’s blog</a> suggests posting at least one to four times per day. That's potentially a lot of work, even though the videos are relatively short. However, TikTok has implemented a way to earn some cash, if you aren’t famous enough to branch out to YouTube or Instagram deals. In April 2022, the app allowed users with 1,000 or more followers to monetize their lives using coins given by users, offering some incentive for smaller creators.</p><p>There's no doubt that TikTok is taking over, and the clock is TikTok-ing away while kids everywhere are busy changing the social media game. So now is the time to get in before your mom starts posting TikTok reminders for you to make a dentist appointment or something.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLWmuoyiqmasmJp6o7HSrWStoZ2aerW7jKmmrKxdpLtuwMikq6ij</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SkyVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
