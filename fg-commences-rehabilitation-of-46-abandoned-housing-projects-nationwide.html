This reassessment is aimed at exploring the advantages that Nigerians could derive from this revitalized partnership.</p><p>In his remark earlier, the CEO of Shelter Afrique, Thierno-Habib Hann, submitted that the organization’s presence in Nigeria is to advance its development financing agenda and recognize Nigeria as an investment destination, given the annual Diaspora remittances of over $25 billion.</p><p>“We are ready to collaborate with FMBN and other institutions across Nigeria to address the housing gap. The challenges are there and the opportunities are also there. As a development finance institution, we are very well positioned to collaborate with the government of Nigeria, and in this trip, we met all the leadership, including the vice president of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, who is fully committed to driving the growth of the sector and invest more in the sector knowing that housing creates jobs,” Vanguard quoted Hann saying.</p><p>The Federal Mortgage Bank of Nigeria established the NHF scheme to ensure a steady stream of affordable funds for housing investment, with a 2.5% monthly deduction from employees’ basic salaries.</p><p>According to the handover document from the ex-FMBN Managing Director, <strong>Madu Hamman,</strong> the bank reported collecting approximately N100bn in remittances through the National Housing Fund in 2023.</p><p>He said, “The highlight of our achievements in the last 22 months includes that for the first time, in 2023 the National Housing Fund collection for the bank exceeded the N100bn mark. This is the first time in the history of the bank that the annual collection exceeded N100bn.”</p><p>“You have to think deeply about how you’re going to be able to satisfy the demands of the numerous contributors to the scheme through various innovative ways of raising finance, which should include going outside the NHF because if we continue to rely on the NHF that would not be achievable.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpkZH1ze5FvZp%2BfXZi8rrnEp5qeq12nsqmtwaKjoqyRqbawuoyonWZsZmKuo63NnaannZRitbDB0qKloGWgp7yrscKtqmamkam2sLrWopueZw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SkyVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
