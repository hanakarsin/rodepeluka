If you've never heard of Infowars or Alex Jones, then count yourself lucky. Don't look up the website, and don't hear any of the insane stuff the site's frontman and founder has said.</p><p>Because for the most part it's just conspiracy theory. Don't get me wrong, oftentimes, it is hilarious. Like when Alex Jones went on a rant about chemicals being put in our water supply that's turning frogs gay.</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"></figure><p>The man also helped perpetuate<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> the bafflingly stupid "Pizzagate" conspiracy</a> that accused Hillary Clinton of running a child prostitution ring from the basement of a pizzeria. When some of his listeners showed up to the pizzeria to "get to the bottom of it," they quickly discovered that the eatery didn't have a basement.</p><p>You'd think that all of these wild claims should have landed Infowars in trouble, and it has. When Jones battled his ex-wife for custody of their children, his lawyer, in court, and all of the wild claims Jones made on his site were brought up, his attorney claimed that Jones was a "performance artist" and that he was acting as a character for the entertainment of his audience.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Watches Fox News.

You can't really stop someone for posting a MAGA-hat wearing, MS Paint version of a laid-back frog-man you created.</p><p>However, you can sue them for putting that likeness on a poster and selling it for profit.
