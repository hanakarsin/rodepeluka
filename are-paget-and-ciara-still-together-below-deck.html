And in April 2021, Ciara opened up to Us Weekly about what happened to finally end things with her co-worker, co-star, and longtime boyfriend. She explained that she realized that she was no longer in love with Paget, even if she does still have love for him. And, it seems, they're better off as good friends.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p>"There were a lot of reasons that it kind of broke down," Ciara told the outlet. "Being in France, we weren’t quarantining, we weren’t stuck together or anything like that. We were there just kind of living life, but you know, I was taking temporary jobs and I just kind of realized throughout taking those jobs that I was happier on my own for a lot of reasons."</p><p>Before the breakup, Paget and Ciara had been engaged for nine months. While Paget himself hasn't said too much about the split, he did respond to an Instagram comment from a fan asking about his relationship with Ciara.</p><p>“All good!" Paget wrote. "Loving life at the moment personally and we are still friends."</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Paget Berry (@pagetberry)</a></p></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Did working together drive Ciara and Paget apart?</h2><p>On Below Deck Sailing Yacht, Ciara previously worked in the interior, but <a href=#>Captain Glenn Shephard</a> moved her to the deck team, where she started working closely with Paget. Glenn believed that Ciara's talents would be better served on deck.&nbsp;</p><p>"That will reveal a little bit of drama," the captain <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">told Showbiz Cheat Sheet</a> at the time. "I’m open to couples on board, whether they come on board as a couple, even if they hook up on board because we live in very close quarters."</p><p>Paget confessed that Ciara is the jealous type on a Season 1 episode, which may not have helped things.</p><p>"If Ciara had another first mate who wasn't her boyfriend, there’s no way she’d speak to him like that," Paget said on the show. While her boyfriend was putting on a toga, Ciara was in the other room rolling her eyes at him.&nbsp;</p><p>"Paget has a very flirtatious personality," she said in a confessional. "I do know that girls sometimes take that as flirting. But it’s not."</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p>However, for the most part, it seemed like Ciara and Paget's working relationship was just fine. It was the real-life side of things that sort of did them in eventually. What their breakup means for their joint future on the show, however, is a little unclear.</p><p>If they are indeed still friends, then working together shouldn't be an issue. If Ciara's alleged jealous streak comes into play, though, things could get messy.</p><p>Watch Below Deck Sailing Yacht on Mondays at 9 p.m. EST on Bravo.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhflr%2Bmec%2Banp6sXZa7pXnCopirmV2owaq4y2arqJ%2BVqbWmvoybnKWnp2Kxpq%2FK</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SkyVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
