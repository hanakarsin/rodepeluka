Kinky developed a major following due to his quirky antics and unique approach to country music (and life itself) — he even ran for governor of Texas in 2006 as an independent candidate.</p><p>Regarding his death, a post to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">his social media account</a> shared on Thursday, June 27, stated that "Kinky Friedman stepped on a rainbow at his beloved Echo Hill surrounded by family and friends."</p><p>"Kinkster endured tremendous pain and unthinkable loss in recent years but he never lost his fighting spirit and quick wit," the statement continued. "Kinky will live on as his books are read and his songs are sung." Due to the mention of his pain and loss, many fans are searching for answers regarding Kinky's cause of death. Here's what we know.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty images</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Kinky Friedman's cause of death may have been related to his struggle with Parkinson's.</h2><p>In the statement posted regarding Kinky's death, it is mentioned that the star dealt with severe pain and loss leading up to his passing, though it did not go into any further detail. However, though no official cause of death has been shared with the public, many fans believe that this "pain and loss" may have been referring to the fact that Kinky reportedly suffered from Parkinson's disease, which was shared in an article from the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Texas Tribune</a>.</p><p>Though Kinky was born in Chicago, his family moved to Texas when he was young, raising him there. Much of his life was influenced by Texas — he graduated from both high school and college there, his family opened a summer camp there, and he lived on the grounds for most of his life.</p><p>Several colleagues have since shared their condolences and fond memories of Kinky on social media. One statement from Kinky's close friend, Kent Perkins, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">summed up his life beautifully</a>: "He was famous as a best-selling author, humorist, songwriter, and singer. But we, his close friends and family, knew him as a rescuer of unwanted dogs and cats, a compassionate, philanthropic, soft-spoken man who devoted much of his life to serving others less fortunate."</p><p>"Somewhere in heaven, I'm sure there's a quiet corner with a big easy chair, a bright floor lamp, a big stack of biographical books, and a few old dogs wagging their tails to the faint smell of cigar smoke," Kent said.</p><p>Our thoughts are with Kinky's family, friends, and fans at this time.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfoLavt9hmnauhlZm6orqMnJiuq5VivKd5w56YraA%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SkyVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
