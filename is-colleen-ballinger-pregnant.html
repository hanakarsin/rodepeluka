The YouTuber behind Miranda Sings gave birth to twins after previously saying she wouldn't go through pregnancy again.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>Congrats are in order! The <a href=#>YouTuber</a> and former Haters Back Off star <a href=#>Colleen Ballinger</a> ‚Äî who's known for her character Miranda Sings ‚Äî has welcomed twins with husband <a href=#>Erik Stocklin</a>.</p><p>Colleen has always been open about her <a href=#>experiences with pregnancy</a> in a way many influencers are not. In May 2021, she announced that she was pregnant again, and in November 2021, she gave birth to twins.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Colleen Ballinger/Instagram</a></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Colleen shared that she gave birth to her twins.</h2><p>Collen and Erik ‚Äî who have an older child named <a href=#>Flynn Timothy</a> ‚Äî are now the proud parents of three children.</p><p>On Nov. 10, 2021, she announced <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">on Instagram</a> that gave birth to her twins. They were initially expected to be born in December. "My sweet babies decided to come early," she said in the post's caption next to a pic of her holding both babies. She also mentioned that there's a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">video of her giving birth</a> available for anyone who wants to watch.</p><p>Erik also made <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">an Instagram post</a> of his own welcoming his children into the world. "A little early but right on time," he said in the caption. "Quite the entrance by these two and they already own me. Can‚Äôt wait till we can take you home."</p><p>In the twins' birth video, we learn that Colleen's water broke on Nov. 6, and that she and Erik didn't have names picked out in time for their arrival. But things took a serious turn when they reached the hospital.</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"></figure><p>At the hospital, Colleen and Erik found out that she had something called cord prolapse. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">According to WebMD</a>, this is when the umbilical cord drops through the cervix and into the vagina before the baby gets there. When this happens, the cord is squeezed between the baby and the pelvic bones and this cuts off the baby's blood supply. This also limits the amount of oxygen the baby receives.</p><p>Because of this, Colleen had to have an emergency C-section. But everyone was okay in the end. For now, we know that the babies are both staying in the NICU and it's not clear how long they will be there before they're allowed to stay home.</p><p>While the birth of the twins is certainly joyous news for the star, Colleen has also been open in the past about the tragedies she and her family have faced.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">In February 2021, Colleen shared she had suffered a miscarriage.</h2><p>Colleen revealed in February 2021 that she and Eric were previously expecting a second child, but she suffered a miscarriage. She shared the news in a YouTube video titled <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">"My Miscarriage."</a></p><p>"Even though I hate pregnancy and mine was extremely traumatic with Flynn, when I found out I was pregnant, I was scared, of course, to be pregnant again, but I was really excited to have another baby," she said in the video. "But then I had a miscarriage."</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"><span>Source: YouTube</span></figure><p>In January 2021, she said she was experiencing more symptoms, and so she took a couple of tests, which all came back negative (or inconclusive).</p><p>But, she said, she still was experiencing symptoms that made her think that she might be pregnant again. So she took another a few days later and it came back positive.</p><p>Unfortunately, a month later, she learned that she had suffered a miscarriage.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Colleen announced in May 2021 that she was pregnant again.</h2><p>On May 17, 2021, Colleen made an announcement video for her channel excitedly sharing that once again <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">she was pregnant</a>!</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Colleen Ballinger/Instagram</a></figure><p>"I'm just so happy. I wanted this so bad. We're so excited. We really were just trying and hoping for this. This is very exciting," Colleen said. "That's a very shocking thing to say because, if you've watched me at all in the last three years, all I ever say is I'm never getting pregnant again. That was the plan until I got pregnant."</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>I‚ÄôM HAVING TWINS! üë∂üèºüë∂üèº <a href=#>https://t.co/UQjxxeqGae</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/L65cufXI21</a></p>‚Äî Colleen Ballingerüéó (@ColleenB123) <a href=#>May 20, 2021</a></figure><p>Less than a week later, she shared the further exciting news, announcing <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">she was having twins!</a></p><p>She said, after experiencing some concerning symptoms, she rushed herself to the doctor to run some tests, fearing she was having another miscarriage.
