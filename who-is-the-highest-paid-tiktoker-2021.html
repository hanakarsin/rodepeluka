On paper it doesn't sound so great: They earn around 2 to 4 cents per 1,000 views on one of their videos.</p><p>You multiply that by several million loops, however, and you're talking some serious cash.

It's approximated that Le earned himself a whopping $20,378,000 in 2020 from 92 advertisements on the platform. If you head over to his page, you'll see he's produced content for Pop-Tarts and Bang Energy drinks in addition to posting his dance-themed clips.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a title=@justmaiko href=#>@justmaiko</a><p><a title=ad href=#>#ad</a> good thing @poptarts helped take my choreography from boring to bangin’ <a title=WhatWouldPopTartsDo href=#>#WhatWouldPopTartsDo</a></p><a title="♬ What Would Pop-Tarts Do? - Pop-Tarts" href=#>♬ What Would Pop-Tarts Do? - Pop-Tarts</a></figure><p>It should also be pointed out that Le made a staggering 30 more ads than TikTok's second-most-prolific ad slinger: Joe Albanese.
