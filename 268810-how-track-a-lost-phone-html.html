Third-Party Solutions â€“ Theft precautionary measures</h2><h3>a. Find my phone</h3><p class=align-left>Find my phone is the most recent feature unleashed by Google to help their client stay safe and theft free. This product came after the company developed My Account service. My Account is a robust system that let Google users access all their information centrally. Find My Phone was specially designed to help people recover their lost phones using google metrics. Apparently, Google and iPhone are the leading companies spearheading the technology behind phone tracking.</p><p class=align-left>Find my phone is an essential feature with far-reaching potential to end cases of stolen phones, or at least minimize them for most parts.</p><p class=align-left>Find my phone is an iconic feature embedded in My Account accessible with ease. Google voice service is set to incorporate <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">all the devices associated with your account</a> or have recently accessed Google servers using your mail.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/cf7422e7b2f5ae3e.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=30><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>How MPost works: Registration, cost, paybill, USSD codes</span></p></a><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/12a30926b239eeed.jpeg><p class=align-left>Interestingly, Find My Phone enables account owners to choose between locking the device, wiping it, calling it, or even locking it when necessary. This feature resembles the services offered by Anti-theft, commonly identified with android devices.</p><h3>b. Android device manager</h3><p class=align-left>Find My Phone is one of the embattled means of tracking a phone using Android Device Manager service. The service is simple and explicitly explains how to find a lost tablet and phone using responsive buttons. It is arguable that Find My Phone is a more adaptable version of Android Device Manager service.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/720/0fgjhs8gj7jl7ce0g.jpeg><p class=align-left>Phone users are expected todownload and install android device manageron their devices for security reasons. As such tracking is relatively tricky to do, Google was prompted to design Find My Phone to add user convenience. Some phone manufacturers do not include ADM making it almost impossible for novice tech users to benefits from such a spectacular security product. Find My Phone and Android Device Manager are two parallel programs used interchangeably without compromise.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/e147e867a05b8411.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Top spying apps to download in Kenya</span></p></a><p class=align-left>These solutions are deemed beneficial in helping people track down stolen, lost or misplaced devices. Google Play Store is one of the leading hubs for anti-theft applications rated as the third party. Most of the apps now available enable a user to track a lost phone using IMEI number. There are several favorite applications you can use for this purpose. Acquainting oneself with sufficient knowledge on how to follow a lost android phone beforehand is desirable. For my case, I <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">prefer to use Cerberus</a>, one of the costly third-party security application.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/d3e6e3362032f40e.jpeg><p class=align-left>When installed, the app captures photos of anyone who gain unauthorized access to your device.
