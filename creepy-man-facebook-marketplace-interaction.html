However, one woman had an eerie <a href=#>Facebook Marketplace</a> encounter that left her shaken.</p><p>A woman, who goes by <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">@coffeetillvodka</a> on TikTok, uploaded a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">video</a> about her experience with an online seller that went very wrong.</p><p>Ali was in search of a new jacket for her young daughter, and she was able to find the item for sale on Facebook Marketplace. She recalled arriving at the house, which appeared to be unoccupied. She was greeted by a man who was seemingly surprised by her arrival, despite agreeing to the sale of the jacket.</p><p>‚ÄúAlready it was a little weird that he didn‚Äôt have the jacket there waiting for me,‚Äù Ali explained. ‚ÄúHe pretended he didn‚Äôt know who I was even though we were just texting.‚Äù</p><p>What happened next was jaw-dropping!</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">After arriving at the man's house to pick up a jacket for her daughter, things went wrong, fast.</h2><p>The man then directed Ali to go around the house to a basement door, before warning her to ‚Äúwatch her head.‚Äù</p><p>‚ÄúImmediately alarm bells started to ring,‚Äù Ali said. She then asked the man to retrieve the jacket from inside his home and bring it to her, but he refused.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: TikTok/@coffeetillvodka</a></figure><p>"I said, ‚ÄòNo can you go get it for me.‚Äô And he said ‚ÄòOh,‚Äù Ali continued. ‚ÄúAnd then he reached in the doorway and grabbed the jacket.

Despite attempts by developers to create a safe place for internet users to purchase items, there have been violent incidents linked to Facebook Marketplace.</p><p>In July, Australia issued a warning to Facebook users after a violent altercation occurred following the failed sale of a $2,000 electric scooter, according to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">ABC News</a>.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty</span></figure><p>The incident saw a group of men attempt to buy the scooter with counterfeit money, before being turned down by the seller.

Police later arrested three men for their involvement in the crime.</p><p>So, please remember to be safe when meeting strangers from social media!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfmL%2Bmsc%2ByZKaZnmKzoq%2FEm6aoo12irrO3xK2npZmTmnqqutOeqZqbpJ68rw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SkyVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
