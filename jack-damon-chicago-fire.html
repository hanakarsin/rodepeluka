She shared that when it comes to Jack, "So there may be a couple of red flags that come with this suspicious newcomer, and I think you'll have to stick with us for the rest of the season to see what they may be."</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Michael Bradway (@michaelbradway_)</a></p></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">Michael Bradway plays Jack Damon.</h2><p>Until we learn more about Jack's true motivation for joining Station 51, let's get to know Michael Bradway, who plays him.</p><p>The new star only started acting professionally in 2021 per his <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">IMDb</a>.
