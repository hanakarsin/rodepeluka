One of Terry G's boys forcefully jumped into the pool without paying and was asked to come out by one of the security guards and the owner of the hotel, Mr. George Obot but he turned a deaf ear. He was then dragged out of the pool and his colleagues reportedly reacted violently which resulted in a free for all fight.</p><p>The musician was said to have worsened the situation when started abusing Mr. Obot. He did not just abuse him but also slapped and rained blows on him as he was trying to calm him down.</p><p>Mr. Obot who confirmed the incident said he was disappointed in Terry G.</p><p>However, a Patron of the said hotel who pleaded anonymity had a slightly different story to tell. His version is that, Terry G and two others wanted to dive into the pool but were told they couldn't. This resulted in a shouting match which brought Mr. Obot to scene. He also insisted Terry G and his crew couldn't dive into the pool. When Terry G refused to listen to them, Mr Obot was said to have thrown a punch at him and that's when the fight erupted.</p><p>Speaking on the incident, the club supervisor, Felix Alonge said it was not the first time Terry G would come and disrupt the peace in the hotel, adding that he always causes chaos anytime he visits.</p><p>Meanwhile, Terry G's manager when contacted denied the singer physically assaulted anyone.</p><p>“<i>It is not true. Terry G witnessed the whole scenario but never engaged anyone in a fight. When the whole issue happened and it was getting messy, he just walked away from the place since he was aware of his celebrity status</i>,” Terry G’s manager said.</p><p>Source: Legit.ng</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rbHGoqtnppdkg3Z%2Bj3FloaydoQ%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SkyVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
