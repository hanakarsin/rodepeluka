"I'm more confident in this than I was in my lipsticks because I was so humbled by my lipsticks that this time around I just, I know that people are going to get them into their hands, and they're going to be like, 'Oh wow, these are actually incredible,' and I get to just start that process getting trust back."</p><p>The highlighters were already planned before the snaffu that was the first try of Jaclyn Cosmetics. She said that her team has grown in the months since the lipstick crisis, and that she found a different lab to produce the products.</p><p>Jaclyn is moving forward from her trolls and the past days of makeup lines gone bad.
