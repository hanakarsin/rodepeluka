Do you have to?" he questioned. "You can sleep with [Black people]. You can bring them in, you can do whatever you want. The little I ask you is not to promote it on that ... and not to bring them to my games."</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>He also stated that he did not want basketball legend Magic Johnson appearing on Stiviano's social media or attending games.
