There is always meaning behind every small detail. The most controversial piece in Igbo clothing is the red wrap. What does it mean for Igbo people? It’s very controversial! It may symbolizes pain and suffering, but it also means progress for the whole community.</p><p class=align-left>In the ancient times, the only person who could wear a red hat was a chief. He was considered to the only one who had this honour. Today, red caps can be worn by almost everyone in Igbo tribe.</p><p class=align-left>Wrappers also have special meanings in Igbo clothing. The wrappers and beads were worn in ancient times instead of loincloths. They were only used for special celebrations. The wrapper also symbolizes mother or a woman.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/vllkyt31rjbbmk8pcg.jpg><p class=align-left>Igbo clothes have a special place in the Nigerian culture and fashion.
