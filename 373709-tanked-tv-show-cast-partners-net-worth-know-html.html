Wayde King</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/cd08b9fc621cda70.jpg><p class=align-left>Wayde King is a TV star and a co-founder of ATM Aquariums. On <i>Tanked</i>, Wayde appears in 96 episodes and all the eight specials.

Commonly known as “the fixer,” Irwin helps the ATM employees in solving complex problems, both in business and relational. For example, working with his children creates a perfect environment for him as a father when sibling rivalry between Brett and Heather arises.</p><p class=align-left>Before working at ATM, Irwin was involved in selling machinery. While ATM deals with creating customised aquariums, machinery knowledge is critical, especially when estimating construction costs. Therefore, Irwin is a crucial figure in the general management of ATM.</p><p class=align-left>When Wayde King relocated to Las Vegas, Irwin was the first to interact with him. Their mutual love for fish and aquariums made him introduce Wayde to his daughter Heather and later Brett.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/441583d73f83253a.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=28><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Katerina singer on the spot for branding Rwandese singers Meddy, The Ben lazy</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Irwin’s financial information is unknown.

Heather King</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/dbb4a887153d4687.jpg><p class=align-left>Heather King is an accountant by profession. She was in charge of books on <i>Tanked</i>, and all transactions by the company must get a nod from her. In some instances, Wayde and Brett delegate her to negotiate on behalf of the company in deals.</p><p class=align-left>Apart from her passion for bookkeeping, she loves fish and building customised aquariums. Her love for fish makes her role interesting, especially when creating challenging aquariums in terms of designs.</p><p class=align-left>In addition to balancing her roles, she interacts with her family and Wayde. The interactions — that revolve around family and Wayde — create unscripted conflicts and sometimes passionate and love moments.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/21494b0daf46a378.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=28><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Presidential dogs: Joe Biden's dogs evicted from White House after biting incident with security personnel</span></p></a><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO: </strong>The cast of Game Shakers: Where are they now?</p><p class=align-left>Are Wayde and Heather still together?

However, her decision to retain her ex-husband’s name was unprecedented, especially considering why they broke up.</p><p class=align-left>While she has worked at Acrylic Tank Manufacturing as an accountant for close to two decades, her real worth is unknown. However, Heather has multiple revenue streams, apart from being a TV star and an accountant.</p><h3>5.
