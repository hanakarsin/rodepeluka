A wonderful singer, she also delighted fans with brilliant takes on hit songs like "Don't Go Breaking My Heart."&nbsp;So, which songs did Rachael perform in the past?&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Chef, author, and TV host Rachael Ray is a mightily talented singer.</h2><p>Rachael married actor, producer, and musician John M. Cusimano in the autumn of 2005 — and they've been inseparable ever since.&nbsp;As the celebrity cook and television show host revealed in a previous interview with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">A</a><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">ol.com</a>, they've barely ever gone a day without speaking to each other either in person or on the phone. It's perhaps reasonable to assume that John's passion for music had a great deal of influence on Rachael as well.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty</span></figure><p>Rachael joined her husband and the members of his band, The Cringe, alongside a handful of other musicians to perform a brilliant new take on "Without You" by Pearl Jam only recently. Taped in their respective homes, the recording and the accompanying video attest to an experimental spirit and a D.I.Y. approach to music-making. The tune featured on the Season 15 premiere of Rachael Ray, and it was also shared on the show's official YouTube channel.&nbsp;</p><p>Enthusiastic fans have taken to Twitter to applaud the show host for her exceptional singing chops.&nbsp;</p><p>"@rachaelray singing with her husband John and his band on the @rachaelrayshow today. Rachael, I never knew you could sing! You sing great!" tweeted a person.</p><p>"@rachaelray you’re a singer baby!!!! Wow!!" wrote another person.&nbsp;</p><p>"Rachael Ray is a singer now?" asked somebody else.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-fyFmx rJYJh"><span>Source: YouTube</span></figure><p>Before "Without You" would have come out, Rachael also provided the vocals for an adaptation of "Don't Go Breaking My Heart" by Elton John, also created by The Cringe.&nbsp;</p><p>Released on June 22, 2020, the song and the video prove that it's possible to overcome the artistic challenges a lockdown poses. Take Rachael and John, who taped the whole song in their beautifully-decorated home studio.&nbsp;</p><p>The fantastic song was performed on the Season 14 finale of Rachael Ray. There's a perfectly good chance that the incredibly talented show host, her husband, and the members of The Cringe might turn this into a regular habit and treat viewers to other, just as catchy adaptations as well in the future. &nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-fyFmx rJYJh"><span>Source: YouTube</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Rachael performed a song on a previous episode of her eponymous talk show as well.</h2><p>Rachael demonstrated exceptional singing chops on a 2010 episode of her daytime show as well. As a previous article by <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">ONTD</a> reveals, she joined Nick Lachey for a special performance of the holiday classic, "Let It Snow!"</p><p>"You go first, I can't sing! My shower hates me," she remarked at the time.&nbsp;</p><p>Clearly, she was lying.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfp66ktMCeo2aqka56tLXNoKo%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SkyVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
