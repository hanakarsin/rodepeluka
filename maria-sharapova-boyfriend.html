The two apparently met at Maria's 18th birthday party back in 2005, and they soon began dating. But, they weren't together for very long, and Adam later said some less-than-nice things about their intimate life together. He subsequently denied these claims.&nbsp;</p><p>Later in 2005, Maria reportedly dated fellow tennis pro Andy Roddick. The pair was definitely high profile on the tennis circuits, and they even got the couple nickname "Rodapova."
