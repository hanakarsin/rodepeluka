Launch date</strong></p><p class=align-left>The ECO currency will launch in 2020, a year from now. However, the exact time is not known.</p><p class=align-left><strong>2. Flexible exchange rate</strong></p><p class=align-left>The currency promises to have a flexible exchange rate to ease inter-country use so that users of the currencies can easily convert their local currency to the currency or vice versa.</p><p class=align-left><strong>3. Average annual inflation of less than 10%</strong></p><p class=align-left>Any of the 15 countries must have less than 10% average annual inflation as a condition for the launch of the currency. What this means is that any country with a higher inflation rate would not be part of the team.</p><p class=align-left><strong>4. Budget deficit of not more 3%</strong></p><p class=align-left>Another condition for all the 15 countries adopting the new currency is that they must have not more than 3% budget deficit. This means that their annual spending must not be more than 3% of their budgets.</p><p class=align-left><strong>5. Availability of at least three months gross external reserves reports</strong></p><p class=align-left>Another condition is that the countries must be able to present their gross external reports of three months on their imports.</p><p class=align-left><strong>6. Central Banks financing of budget deficits must be checked</strong></p><p class=align-left>Whatever the central bank of any country will use to bail out budget deficits, it must nit be more than 10% of the revenue made from the country’s tax of the previous year.</p><p class=align-left><strong>7. Countries using CFA France slightly discouraged</strong></p><p class=align-left>Due to the low interest rate enjoyed by countries who use France-backed franc, such could be discouraged as the currency is already driving high investments for them already.</p><p class=align-left><strong>8. Mixed reactions that it could be dominated by Nigeria</strong></p><p class=align-left>While some slightly fear that it could be dominated by Nigeria, the largest economy in the region, others believe that is a good thing and could offer the country access to a bigger market.</p><p class=align-left><strong>PAY ATTENTION:</strong> <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Download our mobile app to enjoy the latest news</a></p><p class=align-left><strong>9. Appeal to cut off colonial link</strong></p><p class=align-left>The proposed new currency is also seen as a move to cut off colonial link where countries currencies are still heavily influenced by their colonial background, could have a currency of their own.</p><p class=align-left>Meanwhile, <strong>Legit.ng</strong> earlier reported that ECOWAS heads of state and government on Saturday, July 1, adopted ECO as the name of the single currency to be issued in 2020.</p><p class=align-left><strong>NAIJ.com</strong> (naija.ng) -> <strong>Legit.ng</strong>.
