Now, a teary-eyed mother's hopeless plea on the internet where she vented about the frustrations associated with being unable to afford her son's life-saving medication is resonating with a lot of other people all around the country.</p><p>What has hit so many people in Katherine's video is the fact that she wasn't asking for anything: she didn't make an impassioned plea for donations, nor did she rally against insurance providers she just had one question: "How are you guys making it?"</p><p>She says that both she and her husband work full-time jobs and that she goes to school during the day and works the third shift to help take care of her and her family.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>meanwhile during all the chaos and drama in the richest country on earth: <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/zokamZpdfm</a></p>— shoe (@shoe0nhead) <a href=#>January 13, 2021</a></figure><p>While many people flocked to discover the identity of the woman and donate money to help her care for her child and afford the medication that he desperately needs, as he was diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes and needs insulin injections every two hours, people pointed out the "dystopian" nature of the video she made out of pure despondence.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>her Venmo account is “@/Katherine-Schieffer” if you want to donate</p><p>here is a happy little update</p><p>the fact that people have to rely on going viral online to get any help is just dystopian <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/hnlYss0r3J</a></p>— shoe (@shoe0nhead) <a href=#>January 13, 2021</a></figure><p>She thanked the generous strangers who sent her money, but throngs of commenters online couldn't express their astonishment at the fact that life-saving pharmaceuticals, which are for the most part manufactured in the United States, cost as much as they do in the USA.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>I've seen people talk down about the US because our healthcare system "sucks", people from places like Australia and the UK, and Canada.
