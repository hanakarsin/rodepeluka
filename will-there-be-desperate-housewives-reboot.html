"I love to be moved when I watch a movie, and if I'm moved to tears, then so be it."</p><p>Of course, when he does, he's chowing down on <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Cheez-It Loaded Popcorn</a> (y'know, to couple with the cheesy movies).&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Jesse Metcalfe (@realjessemetcalfe)</a></p></figure><p>While Jesse's current on-screen characters are complex individuals, many still remember him as John Rowland from Desperate Housewives.

Jesse dishes what he knows to Distractify.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Will there be a 'Desperate Housewives' reboot?</h2><p>There has long been talk of what a reboot of Desperate Housewives could look like, but at this time there are no confirmed plans in place. That being said, Jesse admitted he would be down to participate in a reboot should the creators ever decide they want it.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty</span></figure><p>"It's always cool to see where these characters end up," Jesse says. "I think it would [do better] as a limited series ... because I think the second time around it doesn't have the longevity that it had the first time. But it's definitely something I would be interested in being a part of."</p><p>Where would Jesse's character, John Rowland, be now? That would really be up to the creators to decide, but the actor admitted he thought John's storyline could've continued on the show.</p><p>"In television, there's no end of the road for a character unless the creator decides it's the end of the road," he says. "So I think the possibilities really in television are endless. I think he could've been woven into the fabric of the neighborhood. But I definitely would've had him stick around a bit longer."</p><p>Even if a reboot never happens, Jesse says he loves to see new fans reach the series through recommendations from friends and family members.</p><p>"When I first got the opportunity to be a part of Desperate Housewives, I never thought that it would achieve this type of status. I think it's super cool," he says. "People are always probably going to harken back to Desperate Housewives because it's so well done."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLatuIytn56qlWKvpnnDnqqpnaKWwaZ5x6isrJ2nnsOmv4yrnJunn6k%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SkyVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
