Unfortunately, the visitors came from behind to score three late goals to sink Union SG’s title hopes.</p><p>The defeat did not only force Union SG <a href=# rel=noopener>to lose the title to Royal Antwerp</a>, but it also forced them to drop to the third spot on goals differential which means that they only manage to qualify for the Europa League ahead of next season.</p><p>Hence, Royal Antwerp and Genk will represent Belgium in the UEFA Champions League next season.</p><p>In his reaction to how the season ended for his team, Victor Boniface who suffered a series of injuries this season and managed to score 10 goals and provided 8 assists for Union SG, admitted that his team’s best wasn’t enough.</p><p>The 22-year-old forward wrote on Instagram: “Hard feeling to write, still very sad about the defeat but proud of the delivery of the whole team and fans. Unfortunately, our best wasn’t enough, but the learning remains to evolve. Pray and thank God regardless of the circumstances”.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpjZH13e49vZq%2Bhk6m8s3nBqKWinpGYsm64wKacp6yjYrWqv4yco66ao2LBqsDLnmSlp6Ooeqq6jJucpZ%2BZqrpw</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SkyVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
