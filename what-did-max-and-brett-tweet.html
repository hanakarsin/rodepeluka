Lisa Vanderpump was asked why she didn't fire Max Boyens and Brett Caprioni after tweets of theirs went viral in January 2020.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">What did Max and Brett tweet?</h2><p>In mid-January 2020, Instagram user @FaceReality16 shared <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">screenshots</a> of older tweets Max and Brett both posted. The tweets were riddled with inexcusable racist remarks including one that read, "It upsets me that the word n‚Äî is not allowed to be said unless you are black because quite honestly it‚Äôs my favorite word,‚Äù which Matt wrote on Twitter in 2012.&nbsp;</p><p>The same Instagram account also shared screenshots of old tweets written by Brett that also were undeniably racist. The <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">screenshot</a> shared several messages that were posted between 2011 and 2013. One posted in 2012 read, "wassup wit black people wearin so much Aeropostale I don‚Äôt get it lol,‚Äù according to the screenshots.&nbsp;</p><p>At the time, Max made his Twitter account private and shared an apology with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">People</a> which read, "I want to sincerely apologize for what I tweeted in 2012 ‚Äî it was wrong on every level. It is not a representation of who I am. I am shocked I ever tweeted that ‚Äî and I am disgusted and embarrassed ‚Äî I am truly sorry.‚Äù&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="margin:8px 0 0;padding:0 4px"><a href=# style=color:#000;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none;word-wrap:break-word>Thoughts on Part One of the Reunion?üçæ Comment your thoughts belowüëá #vanderpumprules #pumprules #sur #tomtom #reunion @bravotv @evolutionusa</a></p><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap">A post shared by <a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px>Vanderpump Rules</a> (@pumprulesbravo) on Jun 3, 2020 at 5:30am PDT</p></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">On Part 1 of the Season 8 reunion show, Lisa was asked why she didn't fire them.</h2><p>At the time the old tweets went public, Lisa shared a statement, condemning the words both Max and Brett said.
