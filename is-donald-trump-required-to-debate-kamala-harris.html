However, following a recent announcement that <a href=#>Donald Trump</a> is <a href=#>refusing to debate</a> presumptive Democratic nominee <a href=#>Kamala Harris</a>, that tradition has been called into question.</p><p>Trump has given multiple reasons as to why he will not debate Harris, ranging from her lack of endorsement by Obama — who has since come out in support of her — to her "radical left" views. But can he avoid her forever?</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty images</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Is Donald Trump required to debate Kamala Harris?</h2><p>In an official statement from Trump's camp, it was initially declared that he would be backing out of their scheduled debate on September 10 due to the fact that, by that time, Harris would not yet be named as the official <a href=#>Democratic nominee</a>. However, many felt that his logic was flawed because Joe Biden, who was originally supposed to be <a href=#>in Harris's place</a> during the debate, would also not yet have been named as the nominee.</p><p>Amid insistence from the left — as well as Harris's own campaign team — that Trump's refusal to debate was based on fear and intimidation, he decided to change his story.</p><p>In an interview with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Laura Ingraham on Fox News</a>, Trump stated his "real reason" for refusing the debate.</p><p>"I want to do a debate," he said, "but I also can say this: Everybody knows who I am, and now people know who she is. She's a radical left lunatic; she'll destroy our country. She wants open borders. ... They already know everything."</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Ingraham: Why not debate Kamala Harris?</p><p>Trump: Because everyone already knows everything</p><p>Ingraham: They’re saying you’re afraid of debating her</p><p>Trump: I’m leading in the polls <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/gmOwg5lzvC</a></p>— Kamala HQ (@KamalaHQ) <a href=#>July 30, 2024</a></figure><p>So, will Trump be able to avoid debating Harris forever? Maybe, but it won't look good for him.</p><p>According to the official <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Commission on Presidential Debates</a>, there is no constitutional statute that mandates presidential candidates debate each other. However, they are now considered to be an intrinsic part of the election process, and if Trump continues to avoid debating Harris, it's likely that constituents will see this in a negative light.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfnsBusM6nmKWcXam%2FtrnPZqmeqaWev6awjK2mZpyVl661sYykmKaZnJZ6qa3Rq6Cs</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SkyVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
