Walz has also famously passed several pieces of pro-trans legislation in Minnesota, including <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">protecting access</a> to gender-affirming care in 2024.</p><p>Of course, the public's response to Walz's stance on period care is split, with many left-leaning social media users supporting the bill</p><p>"Governor Walz made sure menstrual supplies were available in schools, because he understands that period insecurity is real and that girls' periods are unpredictable, and somehow I'm supposed to be upset by this?" <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">one woman</a> asked.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Another person</a> responded, "Most of them are going on about also making them available in the boys' room for access by trans students (since at that age, they're all pre-op).
