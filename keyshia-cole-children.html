Daniel was born in March and the two wed the following year on May 21, 2011.

He’s really hands-on, probably because he’s so little right now. My oldest really wants me to leave him alone as much as possible – I try not to – but his father is there as well ... Also, I have never had a real nanny, somebody that helps me keep a schedule. For the most part, I’ve been trying to do things alone."</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span><p>Keyshia Cole and Niko Hale in 2019</p></figure><p>The best takeaway from that interview comes at the end. Asked about what lesson that carries her through, Keyshia was quite wise. “Life is really not promised. We spend so much time trying to accomplish so many things to fulfill those in our lives, but we also have to make sure that we make ourselves happy as well and be there for our families and children and the people who deserve our love. Don’t waste that time. Gotta be there for them babies, man.
