Nobody is afraid of Wike”.</p><p>He added, “Membership of a political party is personal. Nyesom Wike has not resigned from PDP to the best of my knowledge.</p><p>“Wike has been a great member of this party. We had challenges before the general elections, which, of course, is expected in politics.</p><p>“But that doesn’t mean that he is not a member of the party because he has not resigned. From the record that I have, Wike is still a member of the party.</p><p>“What is more important is the capacity of the party to reconcile itself. We know we have the capacity as a party to reconcile and bring everyone that has been aggrieved one way or the other because of this country.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpkZH1ze5FvZqenkqSxunnIp2SpnKBitrR5wJ%2BpmqGUYrynedKapZysmaS7qrrGZq6io5VivK27xq6lmp%2BSlnw%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SkyVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
