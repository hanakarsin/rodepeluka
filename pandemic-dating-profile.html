It's hard to form lasting connections when you're not supposed to gather in public spaces and you should keep at least six feet of distance between you and any strangers at all times. But one guy, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Nate Hoffeditz</a>, isn't letting COVID-19 stop him from advertising his availability.</p><p>He recently went viral on Facebook for his hilarious, punny collections of dating profile photos from the quarantine. If these don't make you want to date Nate in the apocalypse, I don't know what to tell you.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">“Let me be your prince Charmin.”</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Facebook</a></figure><p>The coronavirus pandemic has people hoarding supplies like toilet paper. The mere fact that Nate seems to be stocked up means he's dating material. And he doesn't just have toilet paper. He's got Charmin Strong. That's the good stuff. Let him be your Prince Charmin.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">“The only thing infectious in this home... is laughter.”</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Facebook</a></figure><p>Look at that smile — I mean, that spread of cleaning products. He's got everything! Disinfectant spray, hand wash, even fancy Method soap. And he clearly knows the importance of regularly washing his hands. What else do you need during a pandemic?&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">“Just looking for a love that’s non-perishable...”</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Facebook</a></figure><p>Folks, if your love is half as non-perishable as all those canned goods in Nate's cabinet, you two will be happy for a very long time. You want a shelf-stable partnership, you know?&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">“The only thing I’m not afraid of catching, is feelings.”</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Facebook</a></figure><p>OK, it may have taken me until the fourth picture to realize this, but someone else is taking these photos for Nate. Who is it? Are they dating? Is it serious? Have they been exposed to the coronavirus? This is information we need to know during a pandemic.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">“Baby you should let me gLOVE you.”</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Facebook</a></figure><p>Sure, this pose is something else, but I'm just impressed that Nate managed to stock up on disposable gloves and paper towels. I've been out of paper towels for days now and have tried finding them everywhere. Maybe I need Nate in my life, if only for access to scarce paper goods.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">“Talk clean to me.”</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Facebook</a></figure><p>Nate's first collection of dating profile photos from his quarantine was such a hit — we're talking 72,000 reactions, 42,000 comments, and 229,000 shares — he decided to do a second batch, and this is the first of batch number two.&nbsp;</p><p>We've moved to the bedroom, folks. This is getting serious.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">“I’ve had the quaranTIME of my life, and I owe it all to you.”</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Facebook</a></figure><p>Nate's not joking around with this one. Once you take a picture with a perfect dog, all bets are off. He's probably getting serious marriage proposals at this point. A dog is precious company during a quarantine. And this looks like a Very Good Dog.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">“Who is gonna lock me down?”</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Facebook</a></figure><p>Now, this photo is a little creepy, I have to say. It could either be a sexy social distancing pose or the picture of a serial killer who's excited he just broke into his latest victim's house. That being said, we love some responsible social distancing.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">“Let me write you a prescription to get vacciNATEd.”</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Facebook</a></figure><p>Nate, if you were the one person in the world with an effective vaccine for the coronavirus, you better believe people would be lining up outside your door. I bet they would offer to go out with you for a shot, too.&nbsp;</p><p>Unfortunately, there is no vaccine available yet, though <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">clinical trials have been approved in China</a> as of Wednesday, March 18.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">“I’m ready to jump into a social-distance relationship.”</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Facebook</a></figure><p>Dang. Nate's got everything you need in a partner during a pandemic: Toilet paper, paper towels, canned goods, disinfectant, soap, gloves, masks, and a sense of humor. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">His photos</a> have been shared hundreds of thousands of times by now, but if you're in the market for a partner to spend the apocalypse with, reach out to Nate!&nbsp;</p><p>Don't reach out too far though. Remember, six feet. At all times.</p><p><strong>The best way to prevent contracting or spreading coronavirus is with </strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>thorough hand washing</strong></a><strong> and </strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>social distancing</strong></a><strong>.
