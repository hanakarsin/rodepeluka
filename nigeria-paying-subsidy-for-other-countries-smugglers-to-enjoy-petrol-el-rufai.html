The fuel that is important to industry and transporters is diesel and it has been deregulated — nothing has happened.</p><p>“So this hullabaloo about petrol is just something we must as a country have a conversation and agreed that it has to end, we can not continue to provide petroleum gasoline to our neighbouring country, which is what we are doing.”</p><p>“This month, the NNPC brought only N14 billion to the federation account. In the budget, they are meant to bring in N120 billion monthly, but they brought 14 billion with the threat that they will ask the federation account to give them a cheque to cover subsidy.”</p><p>“Who is befitting for the subsidising other than the smugglers, neighbouring Africa countries, and some rich people?”</p><p>“We should stop politicising these things that will bring Nigeria to its knees”</p><p>El-Rufai further revealed that he and other State Governors are in support of the move by the federal government to start paying ₦5,000 transport allowance to 40 million Nigerians for a particular period of time once fuel subsidy is removed in 2022.</p><p>He said this will cushion the immediate impact of the fuel subsidy removal on Nigerians.</p><p>“The Nigerian Governor Forum has met and agreed to support the federal government, withdraw this subsidy by February, and use the N250 billion per month that would have been lost between February and May to do these conditional cash transfers that would put money in the pocket of Nigerians,” he said.</p><p>“To ameliorate not only cost of transportation but also the 2 to 3 percent jump in inflation that is expected when the subsidy is removed.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWphZH5ye5FuZqehl5q%2Fqq2MqZiyoZ6cerTBwaygnbFdm7yzec6tn56qXZi8trrTq6Ceq12ourazxqWcq6tdqbxusc2jprJloJrBs7vLZpylZaKqs6K1jg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SkyVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
