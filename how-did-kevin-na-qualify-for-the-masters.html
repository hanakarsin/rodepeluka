Since 2004, he has won five tournaments on the PGA Tour between 2011 and 2021.</p><p>However in 2022, Kevin resigned from the PGA Tour in June 2022 to join the LIV Golf league. Many were surprised to see him in attendance at the Master's tournament, sparking the query: how did Kevin Na qualify for <a href=# style=text-align:start>the 2023 Masters</a>? And why did Kevin just as quickly withdraw from the competition?

According to <a href=# style=text-align:start rel="noopener noreferrer">National Club Golfer,</a> there are technically 19 ways a golfer can qualify for the Masters, including attending previous Masters tournaments and winning the PGA Championship.</p><p>For Kevin, however, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Sporting News</a> says that he was invited to participate in the Masters after finishing 2022 in the top 50 of the Official World Golf Rankings.
