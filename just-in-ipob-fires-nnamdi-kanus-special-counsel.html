Ejimakor a persona non grata. He must desist from parading himself as IPOB and Mazi Nnamdi Kanu counsel from this day.”</p><p>He slamed Ejimakor for claiming that Simon Ekpa and his supporters are followers of Nnamdi Kanu, adding that Ejimakor’s assumption that Ekpa has any connection with Kanu and IPOB amounts to playing script of his sponsors.</p><p>Powerful said: “Therefore, for Barr. Ejimakor and any other person to insinuate or assume that Simon Ekpa has any connection with Mazi Nnamdi KANU and IPOB is not only mischievous but playing the script of his sponsors which we the IPOB family are very much aware of because we know his antecedents. He never meant well for Mazi Nnamdi Kanu but only obsessed with how he can use the position of Special Counsel for personal aggrandizement.”</p><p>“Barr. Ejimakor is just one of the lawyers contracted to handle specific cases for Mazi Nnamdi Kanu. He is not and has never been for the avoidance of doubt, the legal representative of the Indigenous People of Biafra as a movement.</p><p>“He is not an IPOB member. He has no reason to meddle into IPOB operations beyond the special legal matters that he was contracted to handle. He has no authority or permission from the IPOB’s Directorate of State to speak for IPOB outside the few legal matters assigned to him by Mazi Nnamdi Kanu.</p><p>“Barrister Ejimakor has no idea what IPOB is fighting for and does not know IPOB’s modus operandi which is why he attempted to export his lack of knowledge of the inner workings of IPOB and his confused state of mind to the general public.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpjZH15e49qZqOto6l6qrqMoqeoml2btrOx0malp5mdmbZut8CnrKxlo6WypLXApWScp6WjwKa4jg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SkyVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
