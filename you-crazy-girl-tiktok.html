Crazy. You Crazy Girl‚Äù trend on TikTok come from?</h2><p>The original sound being used for this popular TikTok trend came from a woman named Maggie Stetson on March 31, 2022. According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Daily Dot</a>, Maggie stitched a video with another woman named Nicole Elizabeth who showed off the way she eats her Taco Bell in her car. She dipped her chicken burrito into the nacho cheese that was intended for her nacho fries.</p><p>Maggie responded in the stitch by saying, ‚ÄúWow. Crazy. You crazy girl." It turns out Maggie's words of sarcastic shock and quiet surprise can translate in many different ways in so many different videos. If you‚Äôre trying to make a joke about something other people might find a little edgy or weird, this trending sound is absolutely perfect to use.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a title=@mattysirois href=#>@mattysirois</a><p>Anyway back to me‚Ä¶ <a title=fyp href=#>#fyp</a> <a title=fyp„Ç∑ href=#>#fyp„Ç∑</a> <a title=youcrazy href=#>#YouCrazy</a> <a title=youcrazygirl href=#>#YouCrazyGirl</a> <a title=MomsofTikTok href=#>#momsoftiktok</a> <a title=mom href=#>#Mom</a> <a title=mother href=#>#Mother</a> <a title=motherson href=#>#MotherSon</a> <a title=family href=#>#Family</a> <a title=funny href=#>#funny</a> <a title=humor href=#>#humor</a></p><a title="‚ô¨ original sound - Hi ü§ì" href=#>‚ô¨ original sound - Hi ü§ì</a> <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: TikTok/@mattysirois</a></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">There are countless funny ‚ÄúYou Crazy Girl‚Äù TikTok videos to scroll through.</h2><p>A lot of people have hopped on the bandwagon with this trend using the sound in vastly different ways. One user by the name of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">@mattysirois</a> used the trending sound with a text block over his video that says, ‚ÄúWhen you call mom to complain about your life, but she just ends up complaining about hers."</p><p>In other words, he‚Äôs not too interested in hearing his mother complain about her own issues since he really wanted to be able to vent to her. Since he‚Äôs beyond bored from hearing his mom's complaints, his response is as lackluster as the trending sound. Another TikToker by the name of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">@jenonajetplane</a> used the trending sound during a visit to the original Starbucks located in Seattle.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a title=@ashleyymarie.ca href=#>@ashleyymarie.ca</a><p>I want to be invited but I also don‚Äôt want to go üò© <a title=introvertsbelike href=#>#introvertsbelike</a> <a title=taurusbelike href=#>#taurusbelike</a> <a title=youcrazygirl href=#>#youcrazygirl</a></p><a title="‚ô¨ original sound - Maggie Stetson" href=#>‚ô¨ original sound - Maggie Stetson</a> <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: TikTok/@ashleyymarie.ca</a></figure><p>She added the text block over her video that says, ‚ÄúWhen you realize people wait 2+ hours to go into the original Starbucks in Seattle and buy the same coffee they could‚Äôve gotten with no wait a few blocks away.‚Äù</p><p>Another TikToker by the name of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">@ashleyymarie.ca</a> used the trending sound to act as though she was shocked by her own behavior when she canceled a date she was never interested in going on.</p><p>The text box she added says, ‚ÄúPOV: you just made plans you know you‚Äôre going to cancel to watch Netflix alone in bed.‚Äù For some people, it‚Äôs easier to make plans in the moment and simply cancel them later on, rather than to reject the plans upfront. These are just a few examples of many super relatable and hilarious TikTok videos following the ‚ÄúWow. Crazy. You Crazy Girl‚Äù trend.
