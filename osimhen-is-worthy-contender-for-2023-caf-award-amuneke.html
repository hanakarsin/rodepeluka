He scored ten goals in the just concluded 2023 African Cup of Nations qualifiers and finished as the highest goalscorer in the campaign.</p><p>Hence, Emmanuel Amuneke who coached Osimhen in the 2015 FIFA under-17 World Cup in Chile, believes the Nigeria international has all it takes to contend for the CAF Player of the Year award.</p><p>“We hope he wins the Caf award with what he has done for his club and the national team,” Amuneke, who won the award in 1994 told the BBC.</p><p>“Regardless of not playing at the World Cup [held in Qatar last year], he has been able to establish himself as a worthy contender.”</p><p>If Osimhen wins the CAF Player of the Year award in 2023, he will become the first Nigerian player since Nwankwo Kanu won it in 1999, to win the award.</p><p>About the quality of Osimhen, Amuneke added, “There is no doubt about his character, in terms of his desire and zeal to achieve something, succeed and win.</p><p>“As a coach at youth level, that was something that made me admire him. That is one of the best [attributes] for a player to make it to the highest stage.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpjZH5ye49sZqirmaK1prqMoqpmr5%2BnwanFjJymp6yVo7GmvoyfpqtlYmV%2FdHnCmp1mmaeWv6V5wKasp52bmnw%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SkyVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
