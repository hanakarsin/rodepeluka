If zoned to the North, it will polarise the party. When I took the All Progressives Grand Alliance to the APC for the South- East to be in mainstream politics, I was called many names.</p><p>“We should develop national spirit, that high spiritual elevation above personal convictions. It protects the indigent and weak in the society. I see positive and new things to come in Nigeria with such spirit. I agree with Southern Governors on the Southern Presidency.</p><p>“In 1999 – 2007, the Presidency was in the South; 2007 to 2010, the Presidency was in the North; 2010 to 2015, the Presidency was in the South and now 2015 to 2023 the Presidency is in the North. After this, it is normal and natural for it to return to the South.”</p><p>He also called on the federal government to seek a political solution and an out-of-court settlement on the issue of the embattled leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), Nnamdi Kanu.</p><p>In previous reports, <strong>Naija News</strong> recalls&nbsp;Okorocha, has claimed <strong><a href=# rel=noopener>he never received a penny</a></strong> from the National Assembly since he became a senator.</p><p>The Imo West lawmaker said even when he was a sitting Governor, he never collected his salaries.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWphZH16e5FqZmtoYmh6orzCZqSuq6Rix7C6xGanq52jnrGmutOimKVlpJ6wrLHTZquoZaSdsm6%2Fzq6roWWfp3qmuNKeZKijn6e8pLTAaA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SkyVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
