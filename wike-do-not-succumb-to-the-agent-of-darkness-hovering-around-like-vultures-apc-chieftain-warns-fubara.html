It is not about me. People should understand that definitely I am here, I will go, but Rivers State will still remain.</p><p>“I am the governor. No matter what it is, there are things I could have done and there would have been a total crisis. But, the ability to restrain in the face of crisis when you have the power to do things is maturity.”</p><p>Reacting to Fubara’s statement, Eze opined that attempting to resign would mean that the governor had “succumbed to agents of darkness.”</p><p>He advised the governor to bury the thought of resignation, adding that it would be a disappointment not only to Rivers people, but God.</p><p>According to Eze, “My dear governor, resigning or attempting to resign will cause an unpleasant and chaotic situation in Rivers State.</p><p>“Doing that will be succumbing not only to agents of darkness hovering around like vultures to collapse the state, but will cause God to regret using you as a tool to free His children from the shackles of a very wicked emperor.</p><p>“Don’t be afraid as the constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, the entire elders, reasonable stakeholders, God-fearing pastors, youths, pensioners, civil servants of Rivers State are with you and most importantly, God is with you. So, bury the thought of this resignation saga.</p><p>“God will continue to strengthen you until the state is fully recovered from the dusted, arrogant and perilous emperor.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpkZH10e49xZrChm5p6pbuMp6atZaOqsKTBzJtkraddqbWmecCgnKesXaSzbrDAq6KnnaOoeqm71Z6poqaXYq6zu9Snm2akmaCybsLUpauuqpWoeqK8wmaaoaGVm8Gitc1mrpqqnqh6p8HBmqmaZw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SkyVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
