Let’s just keep it 100.”</p><p>“I’m not mad at you because I know who you are. And I know that you do force the issue but I wish you wouldn’t have because I feel like you got to respect people's wishes,” Malaysia told Jackie. “I am okay with never speaking to her again and she’s okay with it. So we should just let it be. I feel like at the end of the day, you were trying to make us friends.”</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>Jackie immediately apologized for her behavior, but did mention, “To be friends it ain’t necessarily be buddy ol’ pals, but we gotta exist together.” That's when Malaysia flat-out said that she would not be hanging out with the group any longer.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>“No bulls–t aside.
