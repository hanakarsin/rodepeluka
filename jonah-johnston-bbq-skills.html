In fact, he has been enthusiastically practicing his BBQ skills since impressing everyone at Elizabeth's birthday.</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dHMjyi gzSWnW"></figure><p>He tells his sisters that he and his friend Brian have been practicing their meat-smoking chops for some time now.</p><p>"I find great joy in smoking meat and I think that when I'm doing it I don't realize how much of a help it is until after I get done with it," he says in a confessional.</p><p>Elizabeth was particularly excited to see her brother "fixing his health" â€” both physical and mental â€” through his new passion. She explains how rewarding it is for him as well as the rest of the family who get to indulge in his cooking.</p><p>Back in Season 11, fans learned that Jonah experimented with a drug called Delta 8. As a result, he suffered some pretty scary side effects.</p><p>After the incident, Jonah's parents temporarily moved him back home. But he has since moved back out, where he appears to be staying clean and experimenting with new positive things. He also started a job as a car sales representative.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">Jonah Johnston previously entered a BBQ competition.</h2><p>In June 2023, Amber Johnston shared a new post on the family's Instagram about Jonah.
