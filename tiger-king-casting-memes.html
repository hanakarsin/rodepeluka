It follows the rise and fall of Joe Maldonado-Passage, also known as Joe Exotic, and his alleged crimes and misdeeds along the way. The entire docuseries is one misstep after another, with wild twists and turns that seem almost unreal.</p><p>And now that there is <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">a miniseries in the works</a>, fans have taken to social media to share their visions through memes of who should be cast in this other version of Tiger King. The upcoming series, which is going to be an adaptation of the Wondery podcast Joe Exotic, has so far <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>cast Kate McKinnon</u></a> as Big Cat Rescue founder and Joe Exotic nemesis Carole Baskin. The other roles, however, are still up for grabs.</p><h2>Fans' Tiger King miniseries dream cast:</h2><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Michael Keaton as Joe Exotic</h2><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>I'm casting the film adaptation of <a href=#>#TigerKing</a></p><p>So far, Michael Keaton as Joe Exotic. Because LOOK <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/5yUPnhXmxy</a></p>‚Äî paddy mcgrossout (@shaw_parquet) <a href=#>March 27, 2020</a></figure><p>There are a lot of ideas out there about <a href=#><u>who could play Joe</u></a> in the miniseries version of his story. But one that seems to hit the nail on its head is Michael Keaton. He wouldn't even need to undergo much of a transformation. All he needs to do is slap a handlebar moustache on his face and make sure he has a bleached mullet and you‚Äôre good to go.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Bill Hader as Erik Cowie</h2><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>if bill hader doesn‚Äôt get cast as erik cowie in the eventual biopic, hollywood is broken <a href=#>#TigerKing</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/WdmQfcNuyv</a></p>‚Äî nisa (@billyberkman) <a href=#>March 30, 2020</a></figure><p>Erik Cowie is one of the few unsung heroes of Tiger King. Unlike so many of the other players, he didn't purposely do anything inherently wrong in relation to the animals and he moved on from the experience, putting Joe and everyone else behind him. Someone like Bill Hader could easily portray his aloofness.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Will Ferrell as Doc Antle</h2><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Lots of talk about casting for <a href=#>#TigerKing</a> show. I need Will Ferrell to be Doc <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/zY1cepAFR1</a></p>‚Äî Danielle Hrit (@daniellehritsko) <a href=#>March 27, 2020</a></figure><p>Will Ferrell is and will always be America‚Äôs sweetheart. It would almost be a crime not to include him in the cast of what could be a dark comedy when the miniseries is made. It‚Äôs still unclear how serious the miniseries will be, but Will can handle pretty much any role thrown at him. He also looks strikingly similar to Doc Antle, so he would totally work as the upscale version of the Tiger King.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Dave Bautista as John Finlay</h2><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>DREAM CAST: TIGER KING</p><p>Dave Bautista as JOHN FINLAY <a href=#>#TigerKing</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href=#>#JoeExotic</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href=#>#Dreamcast</a> <a href=#>#JohnFinlay</a> <a href=#>@DaveBautista</a> <a href=#>#casting</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/pCAFeHck8e</a></p>‚Äî Christopher Giroux (@A_Chris_G_Film) <a href=#>March 29, 2020</a></figure><p>Dave Bautista would have to curb his workout routine a bit, because John Finlay isn't as bulked up as he is, but they do bear enough of a resemblance to each other for Dave to portray John, Joe‚Äôs ex-husband. In the miniseries, John‚Äôs role would likely be pretty important since he was with Joe for years and began dating him at a young age.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Creed Bratton as Allen Glover</h2><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="margin:8px 0 0;padding:0 4px"><a href=# style=color:#000;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none;word-wrap:break-word>Creed to play Allen Glover #tigerking #movie #tigerkingdreamcast #casting #theoffice #scranton</a></p><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap">A post shared by @<a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px> yojadnil</a> on Mar 28, 2020 at 8:10am PDT</p></figure><p>For some, Creed Bratton might not ever be anyone but Creed from The Office. But maybe it's his wild eyes and naturally calm disposition that make him the ideal choice to play Allen Glover in the miniseries. Allen is the man who was accused of accepting money from Joe to kill Carole. He didn't go through with the crime, but he was integral to authorities taking Joe down.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Tyler Labine as Josh Dial</h2><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Casting <a href=#>#TigerKing</a></p><p>The Campaign Manager Josh Dial</p><p>Played by Tyler Labine <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/HRYfyZASiJ</a></p>‚Äî Ryan (@ryan_gay) <a href=#>March 31, 2020</a></figure><p>Josh Dial wasn‚Äôt as big of a figure in the docuseries as someone like Jeff Lowe. He did, however, play a significant role in Joe‚Äôs campaign for the governor of Oklahoma. He was also the quiet voice of reason in Tiger King and among all of the wild characters, you need someone with a strong head on his shoulders. Tyler Labine would be able to do that with a comedic flair, if necessary.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Ed Harris as Rick Kirkham</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Twitter</span></figure><p>Obviously Ed Harris doesn't own his entire Westworld ensemble as the Man in Black, but the entire getup makes him a shoo-in for Rick Kirkman, Joe‚Äôs former cameraman. Not only do they resemble each other physically, but the deep register of Ed‚Äôs voice would match Rick‚Äôs real life voice too. Casting for reenactments or miniseries based on true events isn't always perfect, but Ed as Rick is pretty spot on.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Bryan Cranston as John Reinke</h2><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="margin:8px 0 0;padding:0 4px"><a href=# style=color:#000;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none;word-wrap:break-word>Still at it! #bryancranston as #johnreinke üêØ üêØ üêØ üêØ #tigerking #tigerkingnetflix #tigerkingcast #mydreamcast #dreamcast #pretendcasting #staycreative #stuckathome #staysafe #tigerkingcasting #whowouldyoucast</a></p><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap">A post shared by <a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px>Apryl Redbird</a> (@aprylredbird) on Mar 30, 2020 at 1:31am PDT</p></figure><p>John Reinke was another person in Joe‚Äôs life who tried to do right by the animals. In the end, his life suffered a bit because of his involvement with Joe, but he was able to walk away from him. Bryan Cranston looks enough like him, especially with glasses, to play the part well. The role itself might be a little small for Bryan‚Äôs caliber, but if the cast is full of stars, all of these roles could be beefed up a bit.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">David Morse as Jeff Lowe</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Twitter</span></figure><p>You can't look at <a href=#><u>Jeff Lowe</u></a> without seeing David Morse. Both men have white hair and minimal facial hair that almost already matches and they have similar facial structure as well. All you need to do is get David one of Jeff‚Äôs signature biker jackets, bandanna, and Oakley wide brim hat and he‚Äôs basically Jeff‚Äôs long lost twin.</p><p>The official Tiger King miniseries cast has yet to be announced. There are clearly a ton of options to go around to make it as memorable as the Tiger King docuseries was, though. And if fans have anything to say about it, it will definitely have a star-studded cast.</p><p>Tiger King is now streaming on Netflix.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfqbaosdFmoqKml2Kwor%2FToqWgZZ2auqa%2F</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SkyVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
