She has produced and starred in her own spinoffs, such as Below Deck: Galley Talk and Watch With Kate Chastain, and is quickly becoming a major player in the Bravo family. However, it looks like she quit Chat Room, and fans are wondering if this means sheâ€™ll be returning to Below Deck.</p><p><a href=#>Chat Room featured Kate</a> along with three other Bravo stars: Hannah Berner from Summer House, Porsha Williams from The Real Housewives of Atlanta, and Gizelle Bryant from The Real Housewives of Potomac. The four were set to just do six episodes over two weeks, but it kept extending, and after not appearing in a few episodes, Kate wasnâ€™t even mentioned when Chat Room was confirmed for a second season.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">We donâ€™t know exactly why Kate Chastain quit â€˜Chat Room,â€™ but we have some theories.</h2><p>The most exciting theory of course is that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Kate Chastain quit Chat Room</a> to go work on the new season of Below Deck. The timing is right, and since Kate is still on good terms with the Bravo network, itâ€™s highly likely that they would let her back on the show. Not only that, but fans have loved Kate from the start, so putting her back on the boat would be a major ratings boost for Bravo.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by #PorshaWilliams (@porsha4real)</a></p></figure><p>Because the new season of Below Deck will begin filming soon, many people are speculating that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Kate quietly quit Chat Room</a> to go back to her Bravo first love. Plus, in an interview with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">ET</a>, Kate even said sheâ€™d consider returning to Below Deck. Kate hinted on record with fellow Below Deck alum Josiah Carter, "Josiah, I think you should be chief stew next season, and I would come back to be the third stew."</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Speculation Kate Chastain may be off chat room for Below Deck filming... imagine Kate and Josiah returning?

Some fans have speculated that Kate left Chat Room because of bad blood and high tensions with her co-stars. In a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Reddit</a> thread, one user pointed out that, â€œKate has been liking tweets left and right shading the chat room & shading hannah.

For most users on the thread though, they were watching Chat Room because of Kate, so theyâ€™re unhappy to see her go. Some pointed out that there have been some scandals around Hannah as well that Kate just might not want to deal with.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by WE CANâ€™T BE MANAGED (@giggly.squad)</a></p></figure><p>Hannah apparently laughed about her ex, Luke, being suicidal on Andrew Collinsâ€™ podcast last summer. Then more recently, she was caught up in a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">scandal around racism</a> on the Giggly Squad podcast with her Summer House co-star, Paige DeSorbo. So, although this wouldnâ€™t be nearly as fun as Kate returning to Below Deck, that could very well have been the reason Kate quit Chat Room.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLW6ecOim2ajkamybq%2FHmqqtmZmjerLByK1knKCRqXqzu86m</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SkyVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
