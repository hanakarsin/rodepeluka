But what do they want to gain from speaking untruth?”</p><p>“When the issue of Hijra happened before the pandemic, I had to call on some people to see how it would not affect our productivity because I think we have many holidays already. But much later when they came up with convincing arguments that if we declare a day to celebrate Hijrah, it won’t affect our economy, I approved it. Not only did I approve it, but I also said we should look for a special day to celebrate where we can wine and dine.”</p><p>“I want to use the opportunity of today’s event to address the issues some people brought up. Every time I go through the social media and read what people are saying, those who know how we did campaign in 2019 will admit that we did not abuse anyone.”</p><p>“As a matter of fact, the people of Oyo State know we are doing the right thing. We released the Roadmap for Accelerated Development of Oyo State (2019-2023) document, and told the people to hold us accountable by the document.”</p><p>“I am saying today again, go and look at the document. All the things we are doing now have been documented and we are just following the roadmap.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWphZH16e49vZqynnZp6sbHOqaOeZZSku7V51pqlrWWdrnq0wcKcnKyrXaKurLXNnZxo</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SkyVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
