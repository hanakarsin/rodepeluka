The clergy is a faded shadow of the pioneer leadership that made the church a greatly respected entity.</p><p class=align-left>They are a far cry from the days when everyone, including the president and other top-ranking government officials, stood still and listened keenly whenever the likes of Archbishop Ndingi Mwana a’Nzeki, Archbishop David Gitari, and Reverend Timothy Njoya opened their lips to speak.</p><p class=align-left>These were fearless men who stayed true to their calling and the role of the Christian church to uphold high moral values in society.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/97f8f6d93871ac7e.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>You're Missing a Lot but Persevere: Oscar Sudi Sympathises with Celibate Priests</span></p></a><p class=align-left>PAY ATTENTION: Don't miss trending Kenyan news.
