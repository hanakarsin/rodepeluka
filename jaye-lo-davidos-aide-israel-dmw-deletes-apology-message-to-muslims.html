The singer, though, has refused to comment further on the controversies trailing the 45 seconds video clip.</p><p>Subsequently, Isreal DMW took to his Instagram page to apologize to Muslims on behalf of Davido, saying that the music was purely for entertainment.</p><p>While Davido has kept mum over the issue, Isreal DMW, in the now-deleted post via his verified Instagram stories, wrote: “Let me especially apologise to my Muslim brothers and sisters, on the video my oga posted, as a result of him wanting to lift up somebody, which is one of his hubbies. It was purely an entertainment effort wrongly presented. Make una no vex. Love you all.”(sic)</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpjZH14e5FvZqOZqZp6rbuMnZivoZSkwG6tyJ2cZqGjp66muIydpLBllJq5psDErGSaqJ%2BhvKjFjKacrKuRnLJuwM5mpK6rnJ66tHs%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SkyVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
