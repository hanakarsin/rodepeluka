That is why you see him following his Excellency (Wike) because my governor is afraid of his wife being recalled.”</p><p>He also appreciated Wike for his contributions to the judiciary since his assumption of office in 2015.</p><p>He noted that “The things that he (Wike) is bestowing to generations unborn will be hard to beat. That’s why he says it all. Anytime he has the opportunity, he will say. Yes, he would not be in office forever, but whatever time he has to spend in the office, let it be spent very well.</p><p>“All these things he’s been doing is to put on record that human beings can at any time do far better. I was telling somebody that he (Wike) started far below from being council chairman, and the Lord saw in him a son worth raising.</p><p>“I have no doubt the sky is still the limit for Your Excellency. The whole world is seeing what you can do, seeing what you are doing, and wanting it replicated. It has to be replicated.”</p><p><a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Naija News</strong></a> learnt that Wike asserted that this period appears to be the most tempting in Nigeria’s history for any judicial officer.</p><p>He, therefore, prayed for God’s guidance for the CJN, adding that “Anytime we are going into transition, the crisis we have, will Nigeria survive? Will there be a democracy? My Lord, everything falls on the judiciary.</p><p>“We politicians have our ways. Everything is good or bad, it is the judiciary that is bad. As far as we are concerned, we, the politicians, are saints. The only bad people are the judiciary.</p><p>“We will not do our work. We will not do what we are supposed to do.</p><p>“So, I urge you, that the God that brought you now should also give you and your colleagues all the wisdom to see that this country is united. To see that democracy survives in this country.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH5ye5FuZpyinmKwsLnMnqWdq12stqyxjJ%2Bmq2WYnsBurcKhoJ6ulaKyr8DSZqqasaNitaZ5yKxkoKSRmXqurcqipZ2dXZ7Abq2MppymmpWnerCyjK2fnmWXanw%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SkyVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
