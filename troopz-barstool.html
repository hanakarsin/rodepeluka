YouTuber <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">TroopzTV</a> is leaving his old hangout for greener pastures. The famous content creator announced that he will be ending his current role at <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">ArsenalFanTV</a> for the "opportunity of a lifetime."&nbsp;</p><p>It looks like he has plenty to look forward to, as he dropped a video explaining his situation and where he's going next to all of his loyal fans and viewers ready to follow him on his next gig.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p>Troopz published a video called "Troopz is leaving AFTV," where he revealed his new destination. He won't be quitting the sports game at all, but he'll be taking his coverage to new heights, which should excite those who have been following him since the beginning.&nbsp;</p><p>Curious about what's next for Troopz and where he's taking his coverage? We've got all the information you need about Troopz's next move, as awesome as it is. He's definitely got plenty to be proud of right about now.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-uxeQQ ibmIIm">Why is Troopz leaving ArsentalTV?</h2><p>Troopz is leaving ArsenalTV to go to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Barstool Sports</a>. He will be moving to New York for his new job, as he confirmed in his video on the subject. He'll be hosting a new podcast called "Back Again With Troopz", and insisted leaving the show had nothing to do with any "beef" between him and AFTV.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-cbeQSR faRvJV"></figure><p>“I’m leaving AFTV after four years of amazing times, making some great content, meeting some great people along the way," he said. "I’m moving to New York, without a date at the moment but it will be in the next few weeks, and I’m going to be doing the same kind of stuff.”</p><p>"I don’t want people to feel like I’m selling out, I don’t want people to think like there is beef between me and AFTV, me and Robbie," he continued. "It’s none of that, if anything I want to big up Robbie because Robbie gave me the opportunity. Robbie was the one that convinced me to take this YouTube thing seriously."</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-uxeQQ ibmIIm">Who is Troopz, anyway?</h2><p>Troopz is a YouTuber whose real name is actually Ross. He's been working on expanding his YouTube channel and content since 2016. All that work in four years has netted him nearly 200k subscribers. He also has a large social media following beyond that. His tireless football coverage has garnered him plenty of attention.&nbsp;</p><p>He's been working hard to get where he is, and his fans as such know this is a big opportunity for him.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p>Now that Troopz is leaving to go to Barstool Sports, it's unclear if he will continue to create new YouTube content solo in any capacity, but if he does, it will likely be under his new Barstool banner. This should be exciting for fans who have supported him throughout his journey.&nbsp;</p><p>It'll be fun to see where he goes next from here –&nbsp;the sky's always the limit, after all!&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfqb%2Bwu8%2BzZJuZoqjBsLvL</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SkyVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
