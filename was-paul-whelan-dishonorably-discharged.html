Whelan had enlisted in the Marine Corps back in 1994 and served for 14 years, which saw him on two deployments to Iraq, per the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Washington Post</a>.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>the MSM has reported for yrs Paul Whelan was a marine.<br>I think it should always include<br>The fact that</p><p>"Whelan left the Marines in 2008 with a bad conduct discharge after being convicted on multiple counts "related to larceny"</p>â€” Just Joe ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡² (@JoeMarino2017) <a href=#>August 1, 2024</a></figure><p>But around the same time that folks were criticizing the government's handling of a detained veteran, there were also reports circulating that Whelan had been discharged from the Marines. Indeed, as the Washington Post confirmed, Whelan had been convicted in a military court in 2008 on charges of larceny, which resulted in a bad-conduct discharge.</p><p>For some folks, this led to conflicted feelings about whether or not they consider Whelan a Marine. "Happy for his family, but don't call him a proud serviceman," one person <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">tweeted</a> after the news of his release was reported.</p><p>"Itâ€™s great that Paul Whelan â€” a citizen of the U.S., Great Britain, Canada, and Ireland â€” is being released, but portraying him as a Marine is inaccurate," <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">tweeted</a> another.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrK60ec%2BarKVlp52yra3NZpuiq5iku7C%2BwJujsmWUnsCktMCrnp6c</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SkyVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
