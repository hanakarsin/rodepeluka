Pokimane has more than 8 million followers on the platform and has had an exclusive streaming contract with Twitch for a portion of that time.</p><p>Though she didn't choose to leave the platform immediately after her contract ended, it seems the streamer is moving on to new horizons as she announces she is officially leaving Twitch. What's her next move, though?</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-uxeQQ ibmIIm">Is Pokimane leaving Twitch?</h2><p>It seems after streaming exclusively on Twitch for a decade, Pokimane may officially be leaving the platform. On Jan. 30, she tweeted "The end of an era," with a screenshot of her image on the Twitch app page.</p><p>"Twitch has been my home for a decade. But it's time to say thank you for all of the memories and love during my League, Fortnite, [and] Among Us days," the tweet continued.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Instagram</a></figure><p>She has not yet said what she means by "the end of an era," though Twitch replied to the tweet, proving she's leaving the platform on good terms.</p><p>"What an incredible journey it's been," the company <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">replied</a> to her farewell tweet. "We're so proud of everything you've accomplished and what's ahead in the future. You'll always have a home on Twitch, Poki."</p><p>Pokimane replied to the tweet, writing "STOP DON'T MAKE ME CRY MORE," though she has not shared what her next era entails.</p><p>Some in the replies are suggesting that she may have officially signed an exclusivity deal with Kick. When her initial contract with Twitch was up in 2022, many theorized then that she was leaving the platform.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>the end of an era</p><p>twitch has been my home for a decade..</p><p>but it's time to say thank you for all the memories and love during my League, Fortnite, & Among us days ðŸ’œ <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/S8FMp6G3I8</a></p>â€” pokimane (@pokimanelol) <a href=#>January 30, 2024</a></figure><p>"After a wild 2 years, my Twitch contract ends today," <a href=#>Pokimane</a> tweeted at the time. "Iâ€™ll see you guys February 8th for the next chapter. Much love to you all."</p><p>Though she did not leave the platform them, she's been a free agent ever since, meaning it's possible she's signed another exclusivity deal with a rival streaming platform. Don't expect it to be Kick, though, as she's made it clear she's <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">not a fan</a> of Kick's streaming ethics.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-uxeQQ ibmIIm">Is Pokimane retiring?</h2><p>Another theory some have is that Pokimane is officially retiring from streaming. Since she began building her online platform, she's amassed 5.9 million Instagram followers and 6.6 million subscribers on YouTube, meaning she still has a base of supporters to follow her on whatever she decides to do next.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by pokimane (@pokimanelol)</a></p></figure><p>Pokimane also released her <a href=#>own snack brand</a>, called Myna, in November. Though the launch didn't go over well with all of her followers, it's possible she's choosing to focus on growing that brand in this next chapter of her life.</p><p>Regardless, considering it's just Twitch she's announcing her departure from, it's likely Pokimane isn't leaving content creation altogether, and you'll still be able to receive regular updates from her by following any of her other social media channels. Whether or not she returns to streaming, though, remains to be seen.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfnsBuvM6koKaZnpp6rbHAr6Cnn12pxKrAwqE%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SkyVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
