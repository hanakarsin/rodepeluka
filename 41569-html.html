She came with my four children . But I didn’t see the pregnancy again and there was no baby. I was not happy and reported the case to Orlu police station.”</p><p>Okorie explained that, “ It was when my wife was arrested by the police that she confessed to have sold a-three week old baby for N100,000 to a woman in Ihiala in Anambra State. Thank God that the police recovered the baby.”</p><p>“I didn’t quarrel or have any misunderstanding with her. We were living together in peace.

I have never had any misunderstanding with my husband . I just left suddenly and I went to deliver the baby and later sold it for N100,000. I delivered the baby and sold it after three weeks.</p><p>“I came back to my husband’s house and with his four children and he asked me about the pregnancy but I didn’t say anything.
