Per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Reality Titbit</a>, the Find Love Live host interviewed Kody, Janelle, Meri, Christine, and Robyn separately. So, unlike other reality show reunions, we didn’t get to see any infighting among the group, with the host being forced to interject.</p><p>The same format was followed for Season 18.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>If TLC really want all the viewers to tune in they would have Kody, Meri, Robyn, Janelle and Christine do the tell together like they used to! At that point no one can lie! <a href=#>#Sisterwives</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/ByxaGYqbZl</a></p>— Vitamin_Rea (@Rea_Marie_) <a href=#>November 27, 2023</a></figure><p>According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Today</a>, plenty of bombshells came out of the first part of the special, including that Kody and <a href=#>Janelle</a> had separated, and that at one point, Kody considered reconciling with Meri, to whom he is no longer wed either. But ultimately, Sister Wives fans took to social media to plead with TLC and the host to not go so easy on the Browns, especially when it came to <a href=#>Christine’s role</a> in all of the family drama.</p><p>It seems as though that advice wasn't taken into account for the Season 18 tell all.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Sukanya Krishnan should press the cast of ‘Sister Wives’ harder if you ask the fans.</h2><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Sukanya Krishnan (@sukanya)</a></p></figure><p>On Twitter, the overwhelming sentiment from Sister Wives fans was that the former Good Day Wake Up host let Kody and his wives off the hook when she should have been following up with harder questions.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Former journalist here. I’m watching the <a href=#>#SisterWives</a> Tell All and the host is missing crucial follow-up questions. I like Sukanya, but she’s missing opportunities to ask questions we want answers to.</p>— Chris (@Chris7813) <a href=#>December 19, 2022</a></figure><p>Some <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">speculated</a> that in fact, Sukanya doesn’t even watch Sister Wives and that's why she failed to dig into juicy topics that fans wanted to explore more in the special. To be fair, it may also have been a matter of editing or what producers told her to ask, according to fans. But that wasn’t enough to please many viewers who wanted the reality star family to be held accountable for past actions and words.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Def needed a better host who would have asked better questions and held folks accountable for what they said before. She let them off easy <a href=#>#SisterWives</a></p>— Ether (@dancingether) <a href=#>December 19, 2022</a></figure><p>Specifically, Twitter fans seemed united in their conviction that Sukanya’s treatment of the relationship among Christine, Meri, and Kody wasn’t getting the job done.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>I am so upset by the host actually - the fact she presented kody’s claim Christine discouraged him from reconciling with Meri as a FACT, that she referred to Christine’s “bad behaviour”, that she’s said on Twitter they are all responsible for the breakdown of the marriages…</p>— Ruth (@Not_Doris_Day) <a href=#>December 19, 2022</a></figure><p>Over on the host’s <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Instagram</a>, fans also flooded the comments section to ask her if she even watches Sister Wives, with one person demanding, “Do you watch the show? Going hard at Christine and throwing softballs at <a href=#>Kody and Robyn</a>? Really questionable moderating that doesn't align with viewers.”</p><p>Fast foward to the 2023 tell all special for Season 18 and fans, once again, flooded the comments section of some of Sukanya's content, pleading for her to quit. "You seriously need to quit this job. Please. For all of us who actually WATCH the show. I can’t believe you want to catch the full frustration of fans, AGAIN?," one commenter wrote. Another suggested that Andy Cohen step into the shoes as the Sister Wives tell all host.</p><p>Although Sukanya could just be following her producer's cues, <a href=#>fans of the show</a> don't seem pleased that she was brought back for a third time to serve as the host of the tell all special.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfnby0wIyonWarmajBpr6MsKCvnaNiwaa4y2aYpaQ%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SkyVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
