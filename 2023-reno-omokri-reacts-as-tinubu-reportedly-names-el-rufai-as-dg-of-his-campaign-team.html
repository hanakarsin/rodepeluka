Wow! This is a subtle Jihad against Christians?</p><p>Presidential candidate-Muslim<br>Running mate-Muslim<br>Now DG is also-Muslim</p><p>“You mean that of the many Christian Governors in the APC, Tinubu could not find a Christian to be the DG of his campaign? Not even one? He had to pick Nasir El-Rufai, a notorious enemy of the Body of Christ, as his DG? Perhaps it is not a coincidence that Naira is ₦666 to $1 today! Is that a sign?</p><p>“The only time they needed Christians was for the Fake Bishops show they gave to Nigerians.”</p><h2>Bola Tinubu, Shettima Meet El-Rufai, Matawalle, Oshiomhole, Others</h2><p>Tinubu, and his running mate, Kashim Shettima met some party chieftains regarding the forthcoming general elections.</p><p><a href=#><strong>Naija News</strong></a> reports that the meeting was held on Wednesday at the residence of the APC presidential flagbearer in Abuja, the nation’s capital.</p><p>Some of the critical APC stakeholders present at the meeting were Governor Nasir El-Rufai of Kaduna State, Governor Bello Matawalle of Zamfara state and Simon Lalong of Plateau state.</p><p>Others present at the meeting included the former APC National Chairman, Adams Oshiomhole; APC National Secretary, Senator Iyiola Omisore and the former running mate to Tinubu, Ibrahim Masari.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH14e5FwZmtoYmh6s7HNqGSopZ%2Bgv6p50Z6YnKyjYq60edOipa6apWK%2FprzOq6uenJyueq%2BtzJ6qZp2cYr%2B2ssCiZJqrXZm0brvFZp%2Biq12Yrq68wKKep2Wkmq6uew%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SkyVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
