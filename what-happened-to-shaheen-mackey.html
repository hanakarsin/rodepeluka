Two women had previously accused Mackey of stalking and threatening them. He was booked at the Luzerne County Jail, which is located in Wilkes-Barre, Pa. &nbsp;</p><p>While in jail, a fellow inmate alerted the guards when Mackey allegedly began ripping out his hair, chewing off his fingernails, and drooling. The moments following their encounter with Mackey have been the subject of intense scrutiny, and a video from this time period has been leaked.</p><p>It has gone viral, in part, because Mackey was hospitalized after the guards were called. He was later placed on life support, and he passed away on June 8.&nbsp;</p><p>The Mackey family posted the snippet of the video on Facebook, which is around 2 minutes and 20 seconds in length. It has since been re-posted on various social media platforms.</p><p>The graphic video shows Mackey sitting in a chair, while several guards attempt to restrain him. One corrections officer is holding a cloth around Mackey's face.</p><p>Around one minute in to the video, several of the guards placed Mackey on the floor, where they did CPR.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>WARNING: DISTURBING.
