While some have been a little confused by the rapper's continued presence, most have been delighted to see him in attendance at competitions, and filming segments throughout the competition.</p><p>As fans celebrate Snoop's presence at the 2024 Olympics, they have also fallen in love with a commemorative pin designed for the rapper. Here's what we know about <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Snoop Dogg's Olympic pin</a>.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Snoop Dogg's Olympic pin is the hottest Paris 2024 merch.</h2><p>Snoop Dogg's Olympic pin is silver, and features the rapper wearing sunglasses, a blue tracksuit, and smoking out the iconic Olympic rings. In the background sits the Eiffel Tower along with the word "Paris."</p><p>The pin came to public attention after Snoop gave one to U.S. tennis star <a href=#>Coco Gauff</a> during an exchange that was documented on Instagram. During the exchange, Snoop was wearing a t-shirt with Coco's face as a reciprocating gesture.</p><p>In the video, which was created in partnership with the United States Tennis Association and Team USA, Snoop says "Hey Coco, it's big Snoop Dogg. I have something for you beautiful. This is for you … Go USA."</p><p>Coco received the pin in the same video and seemed immensely grateful for it. "Hey Mr Snoop. Thank you for this pin, this is the best pin," she said.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">The pin has gone so viral online that many are now wondering whether they can buy one themselves.</h2><p>Unfortunately, the pins don't seem to be publicly available just yet, but if the outcry is loud enough, it seems inevitable that one will pop up for sale somewhere.</p><p>Even as some begged to get a pin themselves, others found the entire exchange endearing, particularly the fact that Coco called the rapper "Mr. Snoop."</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by USTA (@usta)</a></p><span>Source: Instagram/@usta</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Snoop Dogg has been a wonderful Olympics correspondent.</h2><p>Although Snoop's level of involvement varies from night to night, he has been a consistent cheerleader for Team USA, showing up in the audience at major events to root on the country's various athletes.</p><p>Snoop, who is so famous for smoking weed that even his Olympic pin makes a reference to the habit, has said that he won't be smoking in Paris during the Games because it's not legal in the city.</p><p>"I’m a very legal guy," <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">he said</a>. "I plan on going out there and doing NBC Olympic work. Being clean as a book, clean as the athletes. They can test me if they want to."</p><p>"I’m going to be out there doing what I’m supposed to be doing to make sure I bring home the gold. Which is me," he added.</p><p>Snoop Dogg is already an American icon, and his charisma has allowed him to shift effortlessly from music into a variety of other pursuits. He may not be competing in anything, but Snoop seems to be well aware that he's already won.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfqLuwu89mm6ifl2K8rcXMqaCcZaCeuw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SkyVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
