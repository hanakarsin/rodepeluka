[These] investments will return revenue in the future.”</p><p>Speaking on the recently NBS report, the minister said due to the rising insecurity in the country, the economy would have grown above 5 percent in the second quarter of 2021.</p><p>Ahmed stated that the agriculture sector recorded slower growth due to the incessant killings in the country and the farmers-herders clashes.</p><p>She said: “The 2021 second-quarter growth reflects better economic performance compared to the same quarter last year. In the same quarter last year, we had negative growth of -6.10 percent. It is also better than the first quarter of 2021.</p><p>“The service sector recorded a strong performance, growing by 9.27 percent this reporting quarter, representing the fastest growth in this sector since 2010.</p><p>“The second-quarter growth of 2021 would have been much stronger than the 5.01 percent but for agriculture that recorded a slightly lower growth.</p><p>“A number of bottlenecks within the system including insecurity which has negatively affected the sector negatively. Also, the industrial sector slowed down to -1.3 percent.”</p><p>The minister added that the non-oil sector contributed majorly to the growth witnessed in the second quarter.</p><p>“The non-oil sector recorded a growth of 7 percent which represents the fastest growth since the third quarter of 2014.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWphZH15e5JpZqenXaOyprCMraZmr5%2Bnv7p5xaBkrKiVlri0ec6nZJunoqe8uLXNoGSsnZ6otqO42GaYp5xdp7K0vM6nqqKanK58</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SkyVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
