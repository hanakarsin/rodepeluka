One thing that's never been up to the user is controlling the size of a photo or how followers can see it displayed on their screens.&nbsp;</p><p>A recent glitch, that was first noticed on May 6, allowed iOS users (people with Apple products) to post extra long photos.&nbsp;</p><p>Users would just have to save these long photos to their camera roll on their iPhones, and then select it on Instagram for posting. A glitch on the app prevented the photos from being properly cropped. After news of the bug caught on, many began posting hacks and tutorials for others to get in on the fun and post their own long photos.&nbsp;</p><p>Others expressed their frustration with the issue online, as it made scrolling through their feeds an arduous task.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="margin:8px 0 0;padding:0 4px"><a href=# style=color:#000;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none;word-wrap:break-word>Tutorial on my bio ðŸ¤—</a></p><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap">A post shared by <a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px>New York Photographer</a> (@haristjio) on May 7, 2020 at 10:17am PDT</p></figure><p>Though some took the bug as an opportunity to post new things from their camera rolls, many of the bigger photos ended up being extremely pixelated and difficult to see. For many, this made the glitch more of a nuisance than an opportunity to post different types of photos. Some posts just appeared as a black screen.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">The long Instagram photo glitch has been resolved.</h2><p>For those who are just learning about the glitch and who are interested in giving their followers a thumb scrolling workout, they are out of luck.&nbsp;</p><p>Facebook, which owns Instagram, emailed <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Verge</a> about trying to fix the issue on May 7.</p><p>"We're aware of a bug involving oversized photos on Instagram.
