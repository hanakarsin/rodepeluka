From learning an instrument and picking up a job to <a href=#>raising a family</a> and building a home, the game does a great job of giving you nearly limitless freedom to live your virtual life. But can Sims get drunk if they decide to partake in one too many drinks during a night out with friends?</p><p>Here’s what you need to know about drinking in The Sims 4 and how it can affect your character.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Can Sims get drunk in 'The Sims 4'?</h2><p>Despite all the ways your character’s emotions and health can be impacted in The Sims 4, they can’t technically get drunk. However, that doesn’t mean you should send them over to the fridge for dozens of drinks each day.</p><p>If your Sim drinks too much, they’ll need to go to the bathroom more frequently. And if they really overdo it, they’ll receive a moodlet that shows they’re feeling sick.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>There’s no reference to Sims getting “drunk” in The Sims 4, so the negative moodlet and constant trips to the bathroom are about as close as you’ll get to being tipsy in your virtual world.</p><p>If you want a more in-depth drinking experience, you can <a href=#>check out mods</a> that introduce various drugs and alcohol to the base game. Keep in mind that these are unofficial and not endorsed by EA – so be sure you check the description for each mod before installing it.</p><p>Beyond that, there’s no way to get drunk in The Sims 4. The closest you’ll get is a sick character, which only occurs after having way too many drinks.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Why can’t your Sim get drunk in 'The Sims 4'?</h2><p>While EA never explicitly states it, getting drunk is probably excluded from the game due to its “T” rating. This means the content in The Sims 4 is “<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">suitable for ages 13 and up</a>,” as it contains crude humor, sexual themes, and violence. Adding the ability to get drunk might bump its rating into “Mature” territory, which could prevent younger players from accessing the game.</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"><p></p></figure><p>The Sims 4 is also a family-friendly game – and EA may not want to include the adult-oriented activity. A few expansions for the game have touched on the idea of drinking, such as the Juice Enthusiast quirk in the Get Famous DLC, and there’s even a Mixology skill available to adult Sims.</p><p>But despite their inclusion, there are only passing references to alcohol and getting drunk without any explicit mentions or an official “drunk” moodlet (and we don't expect to see that change anytime soon).</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfmK6vedKipKxll5rBbrDRrqWk</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SkyVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
