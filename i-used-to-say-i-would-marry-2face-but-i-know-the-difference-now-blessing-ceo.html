Unfortunately, I don’t trust it. I pushed as much as I could but the guy is someone I respect a lot, and along the line, we became platonic friends. I bought another property and moved on three years after. I kept asking about it but they had a court issue. They told me that they would give me another house, but that hasn’t happened till now.</p><p>“I got upset and I was going to call him out but his brother became a king, and out of respect for their family’s name, I backed out.</p><p>“I later found a better construction company and I have been dealing with them since.”</p><p>He also spoke on entertainers who are paid for gigs and fail to show up.</p><p>He said: “When I hear stories like that, I feel disgusted because comedy is not a regular job. One has time to craft one’s content, and even if another event comes up, one can attend both if one plans one’s time well. When a client books one and one does not show up, one has not only disappointed them, one has also been unprofessional.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH15e5FxZqJlpaiypXnTqGSsmalitm7Dzq6jnWWdlr%2BzxYxrnZqblWKvtsCMomSkpp%2BserW0xGabop6Wmr%2BmusKeZKenp2KvrbHSrKCnn12YsrB7</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SkyVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
