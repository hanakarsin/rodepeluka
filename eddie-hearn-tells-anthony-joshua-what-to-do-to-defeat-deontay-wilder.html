That has been the debate that has gained more prominence since Joshua knocked out Helenius last weekend.</p><p>As expected, Hearn who is the chairman of Matchroom Boxing, has submitted that Wilder will lose to the former two-time heavyweight champion in the proposed matchup.</p><p>“I think if he can be a little bit more aggressive with the style that he’s adopted, with the way he’s improved his feet, his movement, his defence, his distance – I think he’s gonna be, it’s difficult to say unbeatable, but I think he beats everyone. I’m so confident he beats Deontay Wilder,” Hearn told Boxing Social.</p><p>Meanwhile, Hearn said his company is not contemplating any other opponents for Anthony Joshua and that Deontay Wilder is the company’s next fight for the Briton. However, if the fight fails to happen, the 33-year-old Briton will compete against a different opponent in December.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpjZH15e5ByZp6clJ6ybrTEmqmnZaSaua2%2FjJqlraCfo8Zuts6sn66ZXay1osCMraZmnJ9iwbB5w56dnpmkYrGmu82tmLJlp565pbHRaA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SkyVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
