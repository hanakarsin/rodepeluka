As of this writing, the presiding members of House of Representatives have failed to reach a majority vote on who will lead the party in the White House. CNN <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">reports</a> that the ongoing vote has become "the longest contest for speaker in 164 years." Much of this days-long stalemate is fueled by Republican lawmakers refusing to back <a href=#>Representative Kevin McCarthy</a>.</p><p>On Jan. 6, Republicans went through 11 rounds of voting over the course of three days, failing to come to a consensus at every turn. As tensions begin to mount, the internet is having a field day with the absurdity of the ongoing vote. Everyone from regular folks to U.S. politicians have taken to <a href=#>Twitter</a> with biting satire and hilarious posts about the vote.</p><p>Here are some of our favorite tweets about the new Speaker of the House.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">A good "head" on their shoulders</h2><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Keeping this head of lettuce handy as the next House Speaker takes office, whoever it turns out to be: <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/Sr7M0BaY2d</a></p>‚Äî Michael Beschloss (@BeschlossDC) <a href=#>January 2, 2023</a></figure><p>As Republicans fail to reach a majority vote for the fourth day in a row, political writer Michael Beschloss nominates a head of lettuce.</p><p>The joke references an <a href=#>ongoing political gag</a> in the U.K., in which the lifespan of a head of lettuce lasted longer than conservative British politician Liz Truss's time as prime minister in 2022.
