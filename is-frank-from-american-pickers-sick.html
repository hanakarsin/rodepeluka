Here's what we know about the health struggles that he has encountered while in the spotlight.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Facebook</a></figure><p>As <a href=#>American Pickers</a> has become one of The History Channel's biggest success stories, the show's stars have also become a much bigger deal. <a href=#>Mike Wolfe and Frank Fritz</a> proved for years that they are charismatic co-hosts with a deep knowledge of the history of American antiques. Even though <a href=#>Frank isn't on the show anymore</a>, his name is still synonymous with it. Because Frank is so well known, in fact, there was a great deal of concern when he began losing significant amounts of weight.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Is Frank from 'American Pickers' sick? He has been diagnosed with Crohn's disease.</h2><p>When Frank first returned to American Pickers looking much thinner in Season 9, fans began to worry that there was something wrong with him. The buzz around <a href=#>Frank's initial weight loss</a> ultimately became so loud that he felt the need to address it and explain why he was now slimmer than he'd been during earlier seasons. "A lot of you have been wondering about my health and my weight loss," Frank <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">wrote in 2013.</a></p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>"I have an illness called Crohn’s [disease], which at times is difficult to deal with," Frank continued.</p><p>Frank has been battling Crohn's disease for more than 30 years, and in that time, he's come to deeply understand the symptoms that come with the illness. The symptoms of Crohn's include diarrhea, abdominal pain, reduced appetite, and bloody stool.</p><p>With Frank's recent disappearance from the show mid-season, fans have speculated his Crohn's disease returned with a vengeance. After revealing he lost a shocking 65 pounds, Frank told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Sun,</a> "The weight loss is me watching what I’m eating so I can keep my disease under control the best I can.&nbsp;I’m just eating healthy."</p><p>Frank added, "Not drinking helps with the weight loss because when you drink, you eat. I’m not dieting." He also explained that his sobriety helped his journey to good health. Previously, Frank admitted he was struggling with sobriety as a result of his split with <a href=#>ex-fiancée Diann Bankson</a>.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Will Frank Fritz ever return to 'American Pickers'?</h2><p>"Crohn’s and travel is all about management," Frank said during an interview with the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">National Enquirer </a>in 2012. "My entire crew knows about my Crohn’s. They understand it when I need a break. I mean … if I have to go, I have to go!"</p><p>Frank stepped out of the spotlight during Season 21 of American Pickers to heal from back surgery as well as address his Crohn's, but he hasn't been seen on the show since March of 2020.</p><p>After a <a href=#>falling out with Mike Wolfe</a>, it was announced that Frank would no longer be on the show at all. Nowadays, Mike co-hosts American Pickers with <a href=#>Danielle Colby</a> and <a href=#>Robbie Wolfe</a>.</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Frank recently suffered from a stroke that left him hospitalized.</h2><p>The latest health issue that Frank is facing is a stroke that has left him hospitalized. Mike shared the news of Frank's hospitalization on <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Instagram</a> on July 21, 2022.</p><p>After briefly addressing their falling out, Mike said "Now is the time to pray for my friend," adding, "Frank has suffered a stroke and is in the hospital. Please keep him in your hearts and thoughts."</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Frank also suffers from mental health challenges.</h2><p>In part because of his fame, Frank said that he also spoken in the past about suffering from anxiety. When he was arrested for operating while intoxicated in 2017, he disclosed that he had a prescription for Xanax. At the time, Frank explained that his celebrity had led him to seek medication for anxiety. Given the spotlight that's been on him for more than a decade, it makes sense for Frank to be forthcoming about all of his struggles.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfnsBustGapaRllqe8rnnAppyroZOWu268yJyinqqjYsCqr8o%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SkyVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
