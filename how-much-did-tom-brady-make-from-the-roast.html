Apparently, <a href=#>Tom Brady</a>'s answer is to get roasted on <a href=#>Netflix</a>.</p><p>After spending 23 seasons establishing his legacy as one of the most notable quarterbacks of all time with the New England Patriots (and later, Tampa Bay Buccaneers), Tom Brady retired from his lofty position on Feb. 1, 2023. Almost immediately after, he began appearing on streaming services.</p><p>Aside from a 10-episode sports documentary on Apple TV Plus, he was the star of a Netflix comedy special roast that streamed live on May 5, 2024. As of this writing, <a href=#>The Roast of Tom Brady</a> has received more than 14 million views on Netflix. However, the former football star has since expressed deep regret over appearing on the show.</p><p>In fact, his reaction to the special has led many to ask how much he was paid by Netflix to make his appearance. Here's what we know so far.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Netflix</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">How much did Tom Brady make from the roast?</h2><p>In the weeks following the release of the comedy special, Tom Brady has admitted that he regrets agreeing to be a part of it. In an <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">interview</a> with the hosts of The Pivot Podcast, Tom said he felt as if the jokes at his family's expense went too far.</p><p>"I loved when the jokes were about me," Tom stated. "I thought they were so fun. I didn't like the way that it affected my kids."</p><p>Tom has three kids from two separate relationships, including from his marriage to model <a href=#>Gisele Bündchen</a> which ended in 2022.</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dHMjyi gzSWnW"></figure><p>Many of the comedians and celebrity guests asked to roast Tom took jabs at his failed marriage and unconventional family structures. Tom has since taken those jokes to heart, hoping to be a better father to his kids from here on out.</p><p>That said, the controversy over the roast has prompted many to wonder if his paycheck was even worth it, including his fellow football stars.</p><p>Retired football star <a href=#>Jason Kelce</a> posed the question on his podcast, New Heights. He began by <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">stating</a> about Tom's roast and subsequent reaction, "I don't get why people do roasts. I don't get why they're a thing."</p><p>However, he was curious to know if the paycheck would be worth the emotional stress of the whole ordeal.</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dHMjyi gzSWnW"></figure><p>That said, there is currently no information on how much Tom Brady made by appearing on the Netflix special.</p><p>Of course, whatever Netflix money he might have earned for the special is likely a drop in the bucket compared to his current net worth.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">What is Tom Brady's net worth?</h2><p>According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Celebrity Net Worth</a>, Tom Brady has accumulated an astounding net worth of over $300 million with a salary of $30 million.
