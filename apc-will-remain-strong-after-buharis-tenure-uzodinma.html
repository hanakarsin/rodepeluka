When he leaves as the President, he will still remain a committed member and leader of the APC and whatever asset at his disposition will still be deployed to the party.”</p><p>“Rather than expecting that the party will be weakened, the party will be stronger because there will be a President who is a huge asset and again a new President that will emerge because, with the activities and achievements of President Muhammadu Buhari, there is no doubt that Nigerians will vote APC in again. And when we have a new President with the former President who is a committed member of the party, this will be a huge asset to the party.”</p><p>“So, I don’t agree that after 2023 when President Muhammadu Buhari will no longer be the President of Nigeria, that the APC will be weak, no, APC will be strong and I can assure you that I have seen a new excitement, newly committed among members and increasing support even among non-members of the APC who are now joining in their thousands to become members of the party. The APC is the party to be any day, anytime.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWphZH1ze49sZpqok2LEqrjLZqmepZGeu26%2F06ump59dlrO1sdFmma6gkae2tHnTnqWuqpViwru7w6Klpplf</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SkyVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
