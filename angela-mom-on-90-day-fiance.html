Glenda was introduced in Season 7 as Angela explained her upcoming trip to Nigeria to see Michael and get to the bottom of the K-1 visa denial. Angela revealed that she not only takes care of her six grandchildren, but also her ailing mother. And Angela's mom was the reason the 90 Day Fiance star was so intent on getting married in the United States.</p><p>The 77-year-old former homemaker supported Angela's decision to not only appear on multiple seasons of the TLC show, but also her decision to marry Michael. It‚Äôs a loss that Angela will likely feel deeply for the foreseeable future.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Angela's mom was on '90 Day Fianc√©' in season 7.</h2><p>As Angela explained, her mom was under her care in her Hazelhurst, Georgia home. It was clear that her mom was ailing and this might have been part of the reason Angela was so desperate to get Michael's visa approved as fast as possible so her mom could see them married before she passed.</p><p>While Angela cared for her mom and grandchildren, she worked as a nursing assistant at a hospice. So, at the very least, she had Angela there to care for her as much as possible until she died. In an Instagram post to announce <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>her mom‚Äôs passing</u></a>, Angela wrote, "We love you moma [sic], But God love you more! Rest in peace mama. We love and will miss you."</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="margin:8px 0 0;padding:0 4px"><a href=# style=color:#000;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none;word-wrap:break-word>We love you moma, But God love you more!

It looks like Michael and Angela might have <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>gotten married in Nigeria</u></a> anyway, though.</p><p>In January, an Instagram account posted a photo of Angela and Michael in a wedding ceremony in Lagos, Nigeria, where he is from. There was also a film crew present, so it's likely that the potential wedding will be shown on TV at some point. Because Angela mentioned not being able to afford to fly her own family to Nigeria for a wedding, her mom probably wasn't in attendance. It's possible she died before she could see Angela get married in the U.S.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TLC</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">They could be back for '90 Day Fianc√©' Season 8.</h2><p>If Angela and Michael return for 90 Day Fianc√© Season 8, viewers might be able to learn a little more about her mom. If they are filming now, then chances are, Angela‚Äôs mom‚Äôs passing will be a storyline for her in the new season, whenever it airs. And the fact that there seemed to be a film crew present in the alleged Nigeria wedding means it‚Äôs even more possible that Angela and Michael will be back.</p><p>Watch 90 Day Fianc√© on Sundays at 8 p.m. ET on TLC.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhflruoscuaZKannWK8r3mYaWSdmalis6qtzZyc</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SkyVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
