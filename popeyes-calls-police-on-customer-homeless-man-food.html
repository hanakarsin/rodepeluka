A text overlay for the clip further drives the point home: "Popeyes in Atlanta would not let me buy homeless man food !!"</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok | @thegirlyjo</span></figure><p>Local news outlet Fox 5 Atlanta identified the Popeyes customer as Georgia State University student Jo Ortega who was picking up a DoorDash delivery order. The outlet reported that Jo noticed a homeless man in the vicinity of the Popeyes who was hungry, so she bought him a two-piece meal, but was met with resistance from the store's staff.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok | @thegirlyjo</span></figure><p>In the viral TikTok video Jo can be heard saying, "This homeless man I'm trying to order a two piece dinner for them..." a Popeyes worker closes the drive-thru window. Jo continues, "Well may I speak to the manager?" the workers ignore the TikTok user as she sits in the car for a few seconds before attempting to get their attention again.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok | @thegirlyjo</span></figure><p>"So I don't know why Popeyes don't let you order for him and he's asking for food."</p><p>Another employee at the store comes to open the window: "No ma'am you can't do it."</p><p>"He's asking for food."</p><p>"Ma'am you can't do it - I don't care about you recording me baby."</p><p>"May I have your name so I can let people know?" Jo says.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok | @thegirlyjo</span></figure><p>The drive-thru window closes again. In a follow-up video, Jo can be heard saying, "They call the cops on me everything bro," as video footage of a police auto unit with lights flashing drives off.</p><p>It then cuts to her waiting in the drive-thru with the homeless individual standing outside of her car. She speaks to her TikTok followers, mentioning that the man she was attempting to buy food for didn't ask for money or anything, just a bite to eat.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok | @thegirlyjo</span></figure><p>Jo was ultimately successful in getting the man some Popeyes. Towards the end of the video, he looks into the camera, waves, and mentions that he does artwork in the park and that Jo was nice enough to get him something to eat. As it turns out, she got the food from that exact Popeyes location.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a title=@thegirlyjo href=#>@thegirlyjo</a> <a title="♬ Love You So - The King Khan & BBQ Show" href=#>♬ Love You So - The King Khan & BBQ Show</a> <span>Source: TikTok | @thegirlyjo</span></figure><p>Fox 5 Atlanta reported that the police responded to a call of a customer refusing to leave the drive-thru. However, no charges were issued and "since Ortega didn't break any laws, they [the police] didn't do anything." Jo went on to say that police officers actually "commended" the young woman for buying the man some food.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok | @thegirlyjo</span></figure><p>Jo added that she was able to get in touch with the manager who let both Jo and the homeless man, who goes by Jazz, order whatever they wanted from the menu without paying.</p><p>The restaurant told the local news outlet that it's: "committed to treating everyone with dignity and respect. We have ensured all employees at this restaurant have been provided with retraining to help navigate a range of guest interactions, such as the situation highlighted in the video."</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok | @thegirlyjo</span></figure><p>Additionally, Jo said that she's started a fundraiser in order to assist Jazz in securing a long-term living situation.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfpbyxsdieqmabkaG5tHnPqKOim5VivK95wq6qraedmr9utM6mnKWdo6h6rq3NZp2op5Q%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SkyVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
