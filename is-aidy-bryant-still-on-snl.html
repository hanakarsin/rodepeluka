That news should at least comfort the fan who <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>tweeted</u></a>, in all caps, “WAIT WHAT THE F--K HAPPENED TO AIDY BRYANT.”</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Aidy Bryant has a good excuse for missing episodes of ‘SNL.’</h2><p>As SNL creator and executive producer Lorne Michaels told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Vulture</u></a> in September 2020, Aidy, Cecily, and Kenan will be in and out this season as they shoot other projects. Aidy, for example, is filming the third season of <a href=#><u>Shrill</u></a>, the Hulu comedy she co-created.</p><p>“Aidy has been doing Shrill, and she’ll be here for some shows and have to go back to that for others,” Lorne told the site. “Cecily is doing a project in Vancouver, but we’ll green screen her for things.”</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span><p>Aidy Bryant</p></figure><p>Cecily’s project, by the way, is the upcoming Apple TV+ musical comedy Schmigadoon; while Kenan is filming an NBC sitcom (appropriately titled Kenan).</p><p>“Kenan can come in the day before, and he’ll be fine; he just knows the drill so well,” Lorne explained. “And certainly that’s the way it is for Cecily as well, and Aidy. Their hearts are here. I have no question about it. This is their first priority. So, I’m happy about that.”</p><p>Besides, Lorne has a vested interest in the three actors’ side projects: He’s an executive producer of Shrill, Schmigadoon, and Kenan through his production company, Broadway Video.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Even so, fans are still upset.</h2><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>Even though fans are digging Shrill, Aidy’s absence from SNL is still hitting fans hard. “I miss Aidy Bryant,” one person <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>tweeted</u></a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Another <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>said</u></a>, “Starting a true crime podcast about where Aidy Bryant is during SNL season 46.”</p><p>And a third fan <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>asked</u></a>, “What is Joe Biden’s plan to get Aidy Bryant back on SNL?”</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Aidy promises to be back on ‘SNL’ soon.</h2><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by aidybryant (@aidybryant)</a></p></figure><p>On Oct. 12, Aidy shared Instagram selfie of her flashing a peace sign, with cattle milling around in the background. “Shrill Season 3 — Day 1!” she wrote. “So, so happy to be back with my friends in Portland shooting @shrillhulu again!”</p><p>She went on: “Everyone is working very hard to make this safe and I’m very grateful… Look at these gals giving me plenty of space! Will be back to @nbcsnl in no time!”</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">You can get your Aidy Bryant fix in the meantime.</h2><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>Based on the book of the same name by Lindy West, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Shrill</u></a> is currently streaming on Hulu, with Aidy starring as a young columnist who “wants to change her life — but not her body” and “is trying to start her career while juggling bad boyfriends, a sick parent, and a perfectionist boss,” according to the show’s logline.</p><p>The actress also has a role in the Audible audio comedy <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Heads Will Roll</u></a>, created by Saturday Night Live’s Kate McKinnon and sister Emily Lynne, and featuring performances by other SNL folks — Alex Moffat, Heidi Gardner, and Chris Redd — as well as Meryl Streep and Peter Dinklage. Should help pass the time until Aidy’s triumphant return to SNL!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfnsBurcidsGaaoq6ur8CMrKuipJxivK950qej</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SkyVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
