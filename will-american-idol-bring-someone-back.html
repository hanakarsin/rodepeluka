I was younger and did not think about the actions, but that’s not an excuse. I want to say sorry to all my fans and everyone who I have let down."&nbsp;</p><p>In an interview with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">MSN</a>, Caleb's mother Anita Guy said that Caleb was 12 in the video, and that he and a friend were dressing up as characters from a movie. “I hate this has happened and how Caleb is being portrayed by people online,” Anita said. “This video was taken after Caleb had watched the movie The Strangers: Prey at Night and they were imitating those characters."&nbsp;</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>"It had nothing to do with the Ku Klux Klan, but I know that’s how it looks," she continued.
