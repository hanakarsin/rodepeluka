He helps her solve crimes and makes the occasional appearance in investigations.&nbsp;</p><p>In a season 3 episode of9-1-1<a href=#>,</a> Romero accompanied the main character, Athena, on an investigation and questioning of a woman who seemed to have not known she had been shot in the head. The two work together to help this woman remember how she got hurt.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>They're damn good at what they do. <a href=#>#911onFOX</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/OTZu5ekpT1</a></p>— 9-1-1 on FOX (@911onFOX) <a href=#>March 19, 2019</a></figure><p>Danny’s portrayal of Detective Romero has become a fan favorite. After sharing a clip to the @911onFOX Twitter, a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>user replied</u></a>, “Hope we’ll see more of Danny Nucci!”</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Danny Nucci played Leonardo DiCaprio’s friend in 'Titanic.'</h2><p>You know when Leonardo DiCaprio’s character, Jack Dawson, runs to the front of the Titanic, stands up with his arms out and shouts, “I’m the king of the world!”? Remember his friend that is right by his side? That’s <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Danny Nucci</a>’s character, Fabrizio! We knew we recognized Detective Romero from somewhere!&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: YouT</span></figure><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>In an interview with </u><u>Cosmpolitan</u></a>, Danny revealed that in that famous scene, they were actually miserable. “We were literally on a platform with the entire crew all around us, so we couldn’t pee, we couldn’t eat, we were starving, and we were frigging miserable and cold. The minute they called "action" was the greatest moment of our lives and then we would just be miserable again. This went on for hours.”</p><p>Unfortunately, Danny’s part was left mostly on the cutting room floor except for a few scenes here and there. He even had a full-on love affair with a woman named Helga that was filmed but never in the actual film. He remembers, “When it got cut, it hurt. I was blown away by the movie but I was more blown away by the fact that I was no longer in it in the way that I had filmed it.”</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Danny Nucci’s first big break was on a soap opera.</h2><p>The first big break that Danny got was on the legendary and long-standing daytime soap opera, General Hospital. He then went on to take on roles on shows like Mr. Belvedere and Hell Town. He really took center stage in the role of Mike Foster on the drama series, The Fosters.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p>He also dabbled in directing on The Fosters to the delight of his cast and crew on the Freeform show. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>According to </u><u>TV Guide</u></a>, he was commended “for his energy while the younger stars were grateful to have someone who knows them so well instructing them behind the scenes.” We hope to see Danny more on our screens soon!&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfmbK1scKtoK%2BdXae8rrHRqGRyaWE%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SkyVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
