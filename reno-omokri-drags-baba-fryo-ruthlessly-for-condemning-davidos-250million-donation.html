Use your popularity to help yourself, and allow the young man help orphans who have no popularity to capitalise on. Scripture says “It is good for a man to bear the yoke while he is young”-Lamentations 3:27. What did Fryo do for others when he was on top? No. Wrong question. What did he even do for himself when he was young?&nbsp;</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>“Has he shown initiative? Did he even publish his account number, like Davido did, and people refused to donate? Other celebrities saw Davido’s action, and instead of complaining, they emulated him, published their account numbers and got love from their fans. Including two twins who just reunited.&nbsp; </span><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Wow! I have never seen such entitlement in my life. Help me because I am popular? Really? Davido is young enough to be Fryo’s son. There is no better advert for the proverb that wisdom does not come with age than the case of Fryo and Davido. Use your youth well so you don’t end up like…”</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWphZH5ye5FrZqudnqR6sLnOpKmiZZSnrqi%2FjJuYm5ldm7%2B6u4yrrK2gnJrAtLjYZp2oql2YvK%2BwxKaloqaXYrGiwsidpqxlYmp9rrXLpaCopl2ZvK%2Bt06Kmp2c%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SkyVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
