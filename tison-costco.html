But that doesn't mean that everyone likes them. In fact, unfortunately, some people refuse to adhere to them at all. Which is, unfortunately, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">what Tison over at Costco has to face</a>.</p><p>While we're sure Tison didn't intend on becoming the internet's hero today, that's kind of what happened. Here's what went down when Tison had to deal with a man who boasts a whole 3,000 followers on Instagram.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Tison, an employee at Costco, faced off with a man who refused to put on a mask.</h2><p>In case you need a refresher, <a href=#>Costco</a>, like most stores who are adhering to government recommendations or mandates on COVID-19, requires that all employees and customers wear masks. In fact, it's spelled out clearly on <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Costco's website</a>.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="margin:8px 0 0;padding:0 4px"><a href=# style=color:#000;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none;word-wrap:break-word>Keeping our employees and communities safe is our priority.

Those with existing medical conditions that can be aggravated by wearing a mask are also allowed to not wear one.</p><p>But the man who refused to wear a mask made no mention of an existing medical condition and he certainly wasn't two ‚Äî although some may accuse him of acting like a two-year-old.&nbsp;</p><p>The viral video of Tison facing off with a customer starts with the man saying, "I just want to show my 3,000 follower Instagram feed, mostly locals," clearly trying to demonstrated to Tison that he intends to put the employee on blast to his "fans" about how he's being told he can't shop without a mask.&nbsp;</p><p>But Tison never gives him the satisfaction of continuing. He cuts the man off, happily waving, saying, "Hi everyone! I work for Costco and I'm asking this member to put on a mask because that is our company policy."</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>.<a href=#>@Costco</a> please give Tison a raise. <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/WSNURPxtDg</a></p>‚Äî chris evans (@notcapnamerica) <a href=#>May 19, 2020</a></figure><p>At which point, the man point the camera at himself and says, "And I'm not doin' it 'cause I woke up in a free country." And, at that, Tison tells the man to have a great day and pulls the man's cart away, while warning him that he's no longer welcome in that Costco and politely asks him to leave.&nbsp;</p><p>The man, clearly agitated that Tison took away his cart, calls him a "p*ssy little b*tch" and then informs his audience that he didn't put on the mask because he's "not a f*ckin' sheep."</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">The internet wants Costco to give Tison a raise.</h2><p>Because Tison's name tag was clearly showing throughout the exchange, many who saw the video are cheering him on by name. In fact, "Tison" began trending on Twitter as the video went viral. And many people wanted to contact Costco to be sure this man gets a raise.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>As a <a href=#>#Costco</a> worker I think Tison deserves a raise 100% <a href=#>https://t.co/TMcNviRMvm</a></p>‚Äî Ko~~ (@Scarlet_Night49) <a href=#>May 19, 2020</a></figure><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Tison doesn‚Äôt get paid enough for the bullshit <a href=#>https://t.co/XEbGsOMlV1</a></p>‚Äî Nestingüê£ (@bunnie1129) <a href=#>May 19, 2020</a></figure><p>Others are using Tison as a prime example of how we should act in this time.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Don't be a jerk like "Mr. I have 3000 Instagram followers".<br>Tison cares that people are protected in Costco from COVID19.<br>Be like Tison.

I was just trying to protect our employees and our members." He followed it up with a photo of himself with the mask off so we could see his full face, while giving a thumbs up.</p><p>The man who took the initial video also posted a follow-up on Reddit that has since been deleted. In the video, the man is shirtless, laying in bed, and can be seen saying, "I have every f*cking right to not wear a mask anywhere because this is not about wearing a mask. This is about control, OK? And I'm not the f*ckin' sheep. Ya'll are the f*ckin' sheep."</p><p>"I was one of the only people in that store not wearing a mask which means that you're protected from me and I'm protected from you, OK?" he went on to say. "That dude was hoverin' over me, he was stalkin' me, he was f*ckin' with me. I just took out my camera at that moment so I could show people how this guy was acting towards one person, OK? So if everyone else is wearing a mask, then one person should be able to fly, if anything."</p><p>"You need to get that through your thick heads and realize that I'm not the fuckin' sheep, OK?" he continued, before reiterating, again, that he was the only person in the store that couldn't adhere to the store's policy on mask wearing. "So everybody else is the sheep."</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: twitter</span></figure><p>"And all you people in the comments, you guys, you guys are the f*ckin' sheep. Look at your comments. I'm the only one who sticks out from all of you f*ckin' liberals. And yes this is a partisan issue," he concluded. "Leave me your f*ckin' comments and talk sh*t to me there in the comments and I'll respond to you as much as Reddit will let me."</p><p>Well, either Reddit didn't let him respond much or he couldn't take the comments like he said he would, because the post, along with his account as a whole, is no longer on Reddit, but <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">his in-bed commentary lives on</a>, thanks to Twitter.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>The best way to prevent contracting or spreading coronavirus is with </strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>thorough hand washing</strong></a><strong> and </strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>social distancing</strong></a><strong>.
