The full trailer was just released on Monday, July 27 and according to the network, it delves into "friendship, first love, identity, and immerses the audience in all the messy exhilaration and anguish of being a teenager — a story which could happen anywhere in the world, but in this case, happens in this little slice of America in Italy."</p><p>It actor, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jack Dylan Grazer</a> is playing the role of Fraser Wilson. Stay tuned for everything we know regarding the 16-year-old actor, as well as the 14-year-old teenager he plays in HBO's latest and greatest creation.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Instagram</a></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Fraser Wilson is a 14-year-old boy simply trying to find his place in a totally new town.</h2><p>We Are Who We Are <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">takes place during the 2016 presidential election</a>, according to Bustle, and it follows Fraser Wilson, a 14-year-old boy from New York City who is uprooted from his home and moved to an army base in Italy by his mother, who is being stationed there as an army officer. At first, he feels like a total outcast and he can't seem to fit in with any of his peers. However, things change when he meets Caitlin.&nbsp;</p><p>Although we don't know exactly what happens between Fraser and Caitlin, the trailer implies they fall in love and eventually experience some level of heartbreak.
