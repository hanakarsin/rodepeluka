This was the man in the first four years of their government with Obasanjo, he was practically the siting president, when Obasanjo was going all over the world was trying to gather collaborations and consensus to get debt cancellation for Nigeria.</p><p>“Most of the institutions in Nigeria that are functioning today which people are benefiting from, Atiku Abubakar helped in forming them.</p><p>“Even these some of rhetoric of corruption they have been saying if we live in a nation of democracy, a corrupt person is someone who has been found guilty by a court of law. And even this charge of corruption, do you know that most of these presidential candidates are under investigation.</p><p>“In America, Joe Biden was investigated during the election. Obasanjo has investigated Atiku more than any other person.&nbsp; Nuhu Ribadu was all over the mountain to fetch evidence until today no indictment, no conviction. But we keep spilling this idea of corruption.</p><p>“Do you know that the corruption that was discovered in the last seven years in this government is far worse than the corruption that has been discovered from 1999 to date? Dasuki was $2 billion; it almost took almost 6 years to investigate. If you carry two corruption allegations in this government will beat the $2 billion.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH15e49uZqiakaiur7bOZqmimpGZwm61za%2BcrKyZnK61scNmmK2hm6p6orrDZp2orZ6Zeq%2B706Ggp59dpbGxecKhoJ6epJa2r3nBsJilmV8%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SkyVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
