And that’s not even counting all the TikTok uploads that have added harmonies, instrumentation, and even dance routines to the original.</p><p style=text-align:start>The lyrics are as wholesome as the music is catchy: “If I were a fish and you caught me / You’d say, ‘Look at that fish shimmering in the sun’ / Such a rare one, can’t believe you caught one,” the song starts. “If I were a fish and you caught me / You’d say, ‘Look at that fish, heaviest in the sea’ / You’d win first prize if you caught me.”</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Corook wrote TikTok’s “If I Were a Fish” song with girlfriend Olivia Barton to “remember the joy of being different.”</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Instagram/@hicorook</a><p>(l-r) Olivia Barton and Corook</p></figure><p style=text-align:start>The song is the creation of singer-songwriter Corook and their girlfriend, fellow musician <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Olivia Barton</a>. Corook explained the song’s origin story as they <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">uploaded the viral clip</a> on April 11.</p><p style=text-align:start>“I was having a very emotional day, feeling insecure and out of place,” Corook wrote in the caption. “So I cried to Olivia and after feeling through it, we wrote this song in 10 minutes to remember the joy in being different. Happy Tuesday.”</p><p style=text-align:start>Sure enough, the bridge of the song speaks to criticism from online trolls. “Why is everyone on the internet so mean? / Why is everybody so afraid of what they’ve never seen?”</p><p style=text-align:start>But then we’re back to self-confident lyrics: “If I were scrolling through and I saw me / Flopping around and singing my song / I’d say, ‘Damn, they’re cute,’ and sing along.”</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a title=@hicorook href=#>@hicorook</a><p>I was having a very emotional day, feeling insecure and out of place.

The song is about how hot I think my girlfriend is, even after (almost) 5 years of dating. I’m just an underdog that somehow got the girl of their dreams, and I will be writing dorky songs about it ’til the day I die.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfnrNutYywnKudXZZ6p7XSoWStoZupvKx50qiloA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SkyVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
