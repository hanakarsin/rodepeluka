The star of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Psych</a>, American Housewife, and Supernatural spent the next two years attending daily physical and cognitive therapy.</p><p>The accident had a significant impact on Timothy's career, leaving him unable to take on as many projects as he used to. We investigate: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">what happened?</a> Will the actor be able to reprise his role as <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Lassiter</a> in Psych 2?</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">So, what happened to Lassiter from 'Psych'?</h2><p>"All we know is that my carotid artery on the right side had dissected. I was doing a really strenuous workout and they think that's what it had something to do with, lifting heavy weights," Timothy explained during an appearance on <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Larry King Now</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>"At some point it was trying to repair itself and they think the wound let a clog go one day, and that's what hit the right side of my brain," the actor added.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty</span></figure><p>After the stroke, the actor had to relearn basic tasks he relied on on a day-to-day basis. During the recovery stages, he partook in various forms of therapy aimed at restoring his physical health and cognitive abilities — but some skills were easier to regain than others.&nbsp;</p><p>"First day on set I quickly realized that a lot of things have changed. [I used to have this] superpower I could highlight my lines once and just have them memorized. I quickly realized I couldn't do that anymore," Tim described on Larry King Now.&nbsp;</p><p>"I have a bit of a blind spot on my left side because [the stroke] affected my optical nerve. So having actors walk around me was a little disorienting, to not quite know where everybody was all the time," he added.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Timothy will reprise his role as Lassiter in 'Psych 2: Lassy Come Home.'</h2><p>The actor was eager to get back to work as soon as possible, and fortunately, he found plenty of collaborators able to make adjustments to accommodate his health condition.&nbsp;</p><p>Take, for instance, Psych: The Movie — which he wasn't supposed to appear in at all. The filming began only weeks after his accident, and the creators reduced Timothy's scenes accordingly.</p><p>However, the actor made a cameo anyway, dissing Shawn (James Roday) in a brief video chat with Juliet (Maggie Lawson) in a typical fashion. &nbsp;</p><p>Only a year or so after the stroke, Timothy was approached by the creators of This Is Us — who wrote the role of Gregory specifically for him.&nbsp;On American Housewife, Timothy plays a stroke survivor who gets caught up in a bitter rivalry between his ex-girlfriend, Chloe (Jessica St. Clair), and her neighbor, Katie (Katy Mixon).&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty</span></figure><p>Psych 2: Lassie Come Home marks the next step for Timothy's road to recovery.&nbsp;</p><p>Not only did the creators name the movie after his character, but they also allocated him a major role. According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">TV Guide</a>, the narrative will be centered on one of Lassie's latest discoveries — and zoom in on an impromptu investigation he, Shawn, and the rest of the eclectic crew carry out at the recovery clinic Lassie lives in.&nbsp;</p><p>Psych 2: Lassie Come Home will be available on NBC Peacock in the summer of 2020.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLWiwIyhmKmolaOypXnTqGSlmaOotrWx0Wadq6edYr20xcKh</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SkyVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
