She commanded a "demon" to leave the aisle so she could shop alone.&nbsp;</p><p>The video is just one of many to go viral in recent weeks following mask mandates in many states and counties around the U.S. But this anti-masker wasn't content to shop near other masked people. She yelled at others to get out of the aisle and leave her alone.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Religious anti-masker with a terrible hair stylist won’t let anyone in the aisle until she can pick out what she wants <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/LuXG09E7Gu</a></p>— Fifty Shades of Whey (@davenewworld_2) <a href=#>July 21, 2020</a></figure><p>"I said get off this aisle!" she yells when the video begins. "I command you in Jesus Christ's name to get off this aisle." When a store employee tries to approach her to calm her down, she yells, "Back off! Back off! You need to leave, in Jesus Christ's mighty name. No."</p><p>She turns around and yells at another masked person: "Back off! Get off this aisle. You are a demon. Get off this aisle and buy something!"&nbsp;</p><p>Once no one else is in her way, she stops and starts to look at items on the shelves, seemingly calmly shopping. When she hears a store employee explaining that there's a customer causing a problem in one of the aisles, she continues, "That's right, until I can buy something, then I will happily leave. I refuse you all and cast you into the lake of fire in Jesus Christ's mighty name."</p><p>Someone in the background can be heard saying, "You don't have that right." She responds, "I said stay off this aisle until I can buy something. Have respect for Jesus Christ's saints." The woman then approaches yet another person who dared to walk down her aisle and scream at them for being there.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>This happened at a Fred Meyer grocery store in Longview, Washington <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/8aNvL9pgeB</a></p>— Fifty Shades of Whey (@davenewworld_2) <a href=#>July 22, 2020</a></figure><p>You can hear the person filming the video ask, "What is wrong with people? Like is that the way you think you're really going to get your message across?" They then explain that the woman started this commotion because she didn't want anyone else to enter the aisle while she was in it so she could get what she wants.&nbsp;</p><p>In a subsequent video, also posted to Twitter, it appears that this woman ended up being removed from the situation and physically restrained by grocery store employees. The video shows her being held down on the ground by an employee and yelling, "Let go of me!"</p><p>The person filming this video explains that she was getting in elderly women's faces and screaming and chasing people off. She wasn't about to stop her behavior, so grocery store workers stepped in to physically detain her.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>It didn't end well for this Karen though <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/AeBGP69T22</a></p>— TeraLee (@TeraLee67964018) <a href=#>July 22, 2020</a></figure><p>This is far from the first incident in which someone confronted people yelling and screaming because of an apparent innate inability to put on a mask and mind their own business. A <a href=#>woman in Trader Joe's</a> made a scene when she claimed she had a breathing problem that precluded her from wearing a mask.&nbsp;</p><p><a href=#>A man yelled and charged at a person in Costco</a> after being asked to simply wear a mask while he shopped. He was subsequently identified and quickly lost his job because of the incident.</p><p>It's not clear what kind of ramifications this woman will face for her outburst. She clearly thinks that her belief in Jesus entitled her to special treatment, but I think the Christian principle is "Love thy neighbor," not "Scream at thy neighbor until they leave you alone in the grocery store aisle."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfp7Kttcaipq6rXZa7tbWMppiso12grrOxzQ%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SkyVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
