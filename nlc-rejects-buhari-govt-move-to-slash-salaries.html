It certainly cannot be the meager national minimum wage of N30, 000, which right now cannot even buy a bag of rice”, he noted.</p><p>Wabba said workers are only alive by hair’s breadth, adding that their survival is a miracle.</p><p>The NLC president advised the government to cut the humongous remuneration and allowances pocketed by political office holders.</p><p>He stressed that workers generate revenue for the government, and do not constitute any unnecessary cost or burden to governance.</p><p>Recall that the federal government had directed the National Salaries, Incomes & Wages Commission (NSIWC) to review salaries of civil servants and some federal agencies.</p><p>This was made known by the Minister of Finance, Budget and National Planning, Zainab Ahmed at a policy dialogue on corruption and cost of governance in Nigeria, organized on Tuesday by the Independent Corrupt Practices Commission (ICPC).</p><p>She urged all ministries, departments and agencies (MDAs) of government to come together to trim the cost of governance amid dwindling revenue.</p><p>Ahmed said the federal government intends to remove some unnecessary items from the budget in order to cut the cost of governance in the country.</p><p>“We still see government expenditure increase to a terrain twice higher than our revenue. The nation’s budgets are filled every year with projects that are recycled over and over again and are also not necessary,”&nbsp;the minister said.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWphZH12e49vZqekk2K%2FprbEnKusZZKqtaK%2ByGaeqK6kYrqwwsRmq6hlo6GutLSMrJilmaKesrR7</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SkyVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
