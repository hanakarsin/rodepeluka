Many are already voting on social media but INEC has no voting centre on social media.</p><p>“Atiku supporters are real, they are original. You can see them and they have PVCs. We have two very important people contesting this election. Atiku Abubakar, the Wazirin Adamawa and Bola Ahmed Tinubu of the APC.</p><p>”Unfortunately both of them are very wealthy but there is a difference. Atiku is a billionaire with enterprise while Tinubu is a billionaire without enterprise. Atiku is a billionaire with enterprise because he has a history of physical business in agriculture, education, oil and gas, media, manufacturing and banking.</p><p>“But the other side (Tinubu) has money without enterprise. Atiku Abubakar has met the constitutional requirements of the federal government that anyone who wants to contest for the President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria must be physically and mentally fit. I cannot say the same as the other person (Tinubu).</p><p>“At 75 what is new that Atiku would be looking for other than to set the pedestal for the upcoming generation to have a life they can call their own? So this competent Nigerian that is highly mobile and administratively sagacious is coming to change the narrative.</p><h2>Atiku Made Peter Obi Popular</h2><p>Melaye claimed that Atiku made the presidential candidate of the Labour Party (LP), <strong>Peter Obi</strong>, a national appeal when he picked him as his running mate in the 2019 presidential election.</p><p>He, however, dismissed arguments that Obi and the New Nigeria Peoples Party (NNPP) presidential flagbearer, <strong>Rabiu Kwankwaso</strong>, would spring surprises at the presidential poll.</p><p>“Obi is a fantastic Nigerian but he was not known nationally until Atiku identified him. Atiku is a talent hunter. Everyone who was a reformer in this country between 1999 and to date was a discovery of Atiku.</p><p>“Atiku discovered Obi before keyboard warriors discovered Obi. Unfortunately, elections are not going to take place on social media. It is going to take place at the polling units. And those that would vote are the people here. So it is now operation votes must count.</p><p>“Out of all the presidential candidates, he is the only one with Presidential campaign experience. All of them are running for the office of the president for the first time. From Kwankwaso, to Obi to Tinubu and others. Atiku has led this route before. He understands it and he will emerge victorious by the Grace of God.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH14e5JqZmtoYmh6osDIpKxmoJWWubW0yJ6pZp2opbKztcSnmp6cXam1orqMraCnrZKqerDAx56prGWdmrmixcRo</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SkyVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
