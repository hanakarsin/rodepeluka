But it isn’t an easy journey, that’s for sure. Just take a look at how Elaine managed to make herself a billionaire in the first place.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Growing up</a>, Elaine was a military brat who lived all over Europe, from Germany to England to Italy.

Soon after, she branched out into her own design firm called Porta Bella Designs, which also incorporated a manufacturing facility, headed by her husband Gary, and retail space.&nbsp;</p><p>By doing all of her design, manufacturing, and sales in-house, Elaine was able to take advantage of the many benefits of vertical integration that her competitors had not yet begun to incorporate into their own businesses.&nbsp;</p><p>After she had years of experience in design and retail under her belt, Elaine started to manage projects from start to finish for her clients, and as a natural extension to her design company, she moved into real estate development.&nbsp;</p><p>Elaine assembled a roster of trusted contractors, painters, architects, and craftsmen to produce one brilliantly designed project after another. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">One of her most well known projects</a> is the iconic House of Rock in Santa Monica, Los Angeles, a 1926 Tudor-style mansion that Elaine upgraded into a pop-up showroom and luxury event space, before she sold it for a hefty profit.</p><p>In addition to her design company, Elaine also owns 40-acre Big Z Ranch in Fallbrook, Calif., where she operates a working farm. She also partners with other local farmers to put together boxes of fresh farm produce that are delivered directly to customers' doorsteps.</p><p>Season 2 of Undercover Billionaire airs every Wednesday at 8 p.m. ET on Discovery.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfmrmitc2eZJytnKTBtbWMrqWdnaKYvLex0WaZoqScnryvrcirnA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SkyVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
