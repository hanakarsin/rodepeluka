The show features contestants who were kicked off The Bachelor and The Bachelorette who are trying to find love in an exotic tropical location.&nbsp;</p><h2>Where is Bachelor in Paradise filmed?&nbsp;</h2><p>The show is filmed at the Playa Escondida Resort in Sayulita, Mexico, 40 minutes away from the city of Puerto Vallarta.. The resort has four different types of beachfront villas and range in price from $165 per night to $495 —&nbsp;if you want to check it out yourself.&nbsp;</p><h2>How does Bachelor in Paradise work?&nbsp;</h2><p>There is no grand prize for making it to the end, except finding "the one." So, here's how the show works. The first night, there is an uneven number of men and women, which means after the first rose ceremony, two men or two women (who are not coupled up) are eliminated. For seven weeks, it alternates between two men or two women joining the cast, which means new couples can form. Each week, the two contestants who don't receive a rose are eliminated, until the remaining couples decide if they want to get engaged, take their relationship off the beach, or call it quits.&nbsp;</p><h2>Who is the bartender on Bachelor in Paradise?&nbsp;</h2><p>From Season 1 to Season 3, the resident bartender on BiP was Jorge Moreno, who left the show ahead of Season 4 to start his own tourist company.&nbsp;</p><p>"Jorge is doing his own thing," Ashley I. explained in 2017. "He has his own tour company... so he’s building his own company and he won’t be here this year."</p><p>His replacement was Bachelorette alum Wells Adams.&nbsp;</p><h2>Which Bachelor in Paradise couples are still together?&nbsp;</h2><ul><li>Ashley Iaconetti and Jared Haibon (Season 2)</li><li>Jade Roper and Tanner Tolbert (Season 2 )</li><li>Carly Waddell and Evan Bass (Season 3)</li><li>Raven Gates and Adam Gottschalk (Season 4)</li><li>Kendall Long and Joe Amabile (Season 5)</li><li>Astrid Loch and Kevin Wendt (Season 5)</li><li>Krystal Nielson and Chris Randone (Season 5)</li></ul><h2><br></h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKxfl66ktMSlpqtlmaN6sa3Rmpuiq5U%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SkyVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
