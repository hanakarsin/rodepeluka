And as you rightly know, obedient to court orders and court judgments.</p><p>“But then you have to understand within the context of such obedience that there are associated rights and interests that are vested in the Federal Government.</p><p>“Inclusive of rights of appealing against a judgment, inclusive of the right to file an application for setting aside the purported judgment and order.</p><p>“And indeed, inclusive of the possibility of filling a fresh action if indeed the jurisdiction of the court that was alleged to have indeed handed that judgment is an issue.</p><p>“So, we are doing the needful in terms of looking at the law as it exists and then working within the context of the law in ensuring that justice is done as far as the contending issues between the parties are concerned.”</p><p>Reacting in a post on his Facebook page, Yomi Aliyu wondered what fresh charge the federal government will file against his client.</p><p>He posted, “#SundayIgbohosRights: Hon AGF, Malam Malami SAN, finally agreed that he would abide by the judgment of Ibadan High Court pending the time he will either apply to set the judgment aside or file a new application(?) or file a fresh charge or appeal the judgement! Meaning our client, CHIEF SUNDAY ADEYEMO A.K.A IGBOHO OOSA, will not be harassed, molested or even killed until the Federal Government makes up his mind on what it will do!</p><p>“However, one wonders what fresh application or charge MLBS Malami SAN, is referring to! We wish him safe trip back to Nigeria from New York where a foreign journalist confronted him with the N20 billion judgment we got against DSS and himself.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWphZH16e5FtZqytnpmuunnIoJmooJ9irqiyjKaYpZmdnnqprdJmmKCqlZqxbsDOZpiboZSaeqPFjJymrqqkYre2sMaepJ6mpGK5osPYnqlo</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SkyVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
