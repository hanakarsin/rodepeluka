That's shifted, thankfully, though there is still a dearth of diversity. But the shift in the gender gap has highlighted how bias in the real world has crossed over to how people experience made-up ones.</p><p>Author and editor Danielle Binks brought the issue up on Twitter. She works primarily in Young Adult, and has said she has noticed that in negative reviews, readers don't say they didn't enjoy the story structure or found the prose boring. They often just say how stupid and bad the female protagonist is:</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>YA observation: I am always a little ... disappointed when I read low-star reviews, that cite a female protagonist being unlikeable and her actions immoral as the reasons for hating the whole book.</p>‚Äî Danielle Binks (@danielle_binks) <a href=#>February 5, 2018</a></figure><p>Binks thinks it's especially bad when the female characters getting dragged are teen girls. It seems like there's not even room for characters to be messy and make mistakes when they're kids if they're also women.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>So I'm especially concerned when young female teen characters are chastised for their imperfections too. For not being 100% likeable for all 350 pages or so - really, they're "marked down" for making mistakes, fucking up and being messy and just HUMAN.</p>‚Äî Danielle Binks (@danielle_binks) <a href=#>February 5, 2018</a></figure><p>But have you considered how boring the book would be if they weren't flawed?</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>I often think it's an echo of a society that thinks women have to be "nice" and uncomplicated, all smooth-edges and purity. But that's not necessarily interesting. It's certainly not where conflict lies.</p>‚Äî Danielle Binks (@danielle_binks) <a href=#>February 5, 2018</a></figure><p>Her musings reminded her of something Shonda Rhimes recently said about how she sees female characters described in television.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Shonda Rhimes really got me thinking about this.<br>Because - fuck perfect. Gimme messy. That's where good story lies. <a href=#>https://t.co/Qy3cOOFaM2</a></p>‚Äî Danielle Binks (@danielle_binks) <a href=#>February 5, 2018</a></figure><p>Rhimes thinks the term "strong smart women" is condescending. We don't say Dumb Weak Women to describe other characters‚Äîunless we're really horrible, I guess.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Okay. Entertainment industry, time to stop using the phrases "Smart Strong Women" and "Strong Female Leads". There are no Dumb Weak Women. A smart strong woman is just a WOMAN. Also? "Women" are not a TV trend -- we're half the planet.</p>‚Äî shonda rhimes (@shondarhimes) <a href=#>February 1, 2018</a></figure><p>Binks says that her observation isn't new, but we should consider why we applaud flawed male characters and now women, especially if we actually want to read something compelling.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>This is not a new revelation. Others have said similar. Because every goddam famous male YA protag - from Harry Potter to Holden Caulfield - is praised for being multidimensional and imperfect ... I'd love to see us praising similar complexity in ALL characters. <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/3I5hJfMNLt</a></p>‚Äî Danielle Binks (@danielle_binks) <a href=#>February 5, 2018</a></figure><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Complicated is not bad.

She pisses me off. She's rude. She's selfish. She doesn't know her place.'</p><p>Reactions to the hero's mistakes: 'It's understandable. Poor baby. I still love him.

It's okay for men to be flawed because it makes then sexier. It's okay for them to make mistakes because it makes them real.
