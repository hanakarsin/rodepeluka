Despite her unwavering dedication to the television program, it seems her recent allegations of sexual harassment on set are what led to her contract not being resigned.</p><p>In February, Adrienne filed a lawsuit alleging sexual harassment against the women on set with Corday Productions, claiming that former director and executive producer Albert Alarr made inappropriate comments, created a toxic work environment, and forcefully groped and kissed some of the women on set.</p><p>Though Albert was ousted from the program, so was Adrianne. Why did she leave?</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty images</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Why did Adrianne leave 'Days of Our Lives'?</h2><p>Per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Deadline</a>, Adrianne claims that she was "pushed out of my longtime career" following the lawsuit, alleging that she didn't decide to leave the show of her own accord.</p><p>“For quite some time I’ve seen my female coworkers sexually harassed, violated and degraded as women by Albert,” she said, per the outlet. “I myself have also been degraded, violated, and degraded. In March of 2023, several female employees were fired. There was complete dissolution of the all-female PR department. Female contracts were not renewed, or they were not returning because of the way they were being treated on the show."</p><p>Following these complaints, Adrianne claims that her agents were notified that her pay would be reduced, following the notification that her character would be written out of the show.</p><p>Her contract was ultimately not renewed, and though she'll be present on the program throughout the summer unless a new contract is negotiated, it looks as though her time with Days of Our Lives will be over very soon.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLW6ecOim2aZop6ur7rEZrGum5uav264xJqtnmWUlsa0ec6fZKitomK5qsLErA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SkyVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
