The State House of Assembly has in total 24 members, <strong><a href=# rel=noopener>APC</a></strong> took a larger number of the members having 23 of them with Agboola as lone PDP to make the list of 24 members of the legislature.</p><p>He was, however, suspended on Tuesday for alleged contempt and abuse of privilege.</p><p>The suspension followed a motion without privilege moved by the leader of the House, Abubakar Magaji Olawoyin during Tuesdayâ€™s plenary.</p><p>Olawoyin, leading the debate on the motion, argued that the assembly is an institution and not an individual which must be respected.</p><p>He accused Agboola of making a despicable comment about the House calling on the masses to stage a protest against the government and the House of Assembly on a radio programme aired on Tuesday morning.</p><p>Olawoyin, who described the act at this period of insecurity as unsafe and could lead to chaos, said the suspended Agboola disrespected the honourable House, urging the speaker to investigate the matter which was already trending on social media.</p><p>Another lawmaker, representing Isin constituency, Olumide Awolola Ayokunle, said the derogatory language against the House should not be condoned, especially when such language was found to be false.</p><p>Speaker of the House, Engr. Yakubu Salihu Danladi assured the House of adequate investigation and directed the House Committee on Ethics, Privileges and Judiciary to conduct an investigation into the matter and report its findings to the House as soon as possible.</p><p>The speaker also directed the suspended PDP member to cease attending the plenary pending the conclusion of an investigation into the matter.</p><p>Agboola has, however, said the suspension will not stand the test of time. He alleged that the management of the House of Assembly, denied him some of his financial entitlements since he was sworn in.</p><p>He said he will soon make his position known to the public on the next line of action.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWphZH14e5BsZqimnK56sbDPZqSepZKav261zWaisJmilnqpu9SsnGanlmKutL%2FEppmlsV2owrS8xKebnpxf</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SkyVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
