This was a programme that was planned over three months ago. I had to go to the United Kingdom, I had to go to the United States of America.</p><p>“I actually met with Governor Wike in London and met with my brother, the Governor of Oyo State, Makinde, and the Governor of Abia state. That provided an opportunity to brainstorm on what was happening back home at our party, the PDP especially.”</p><p>Ortom noted that the 2023 presidential election would be a repeat of what happened in the Osun governorship election, which was <strong><a href=#>won</a></strong> by the candidate of the PDP, Senator Adeleke.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH14e5FrZrCgqWLEqrfEZqSao5mjsaZ5wKebZqFdmbalutNmmK2slaOxbrvSrqVmqJSleq6xxppkq5mcocZuu9GtpqZn</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SkyVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
