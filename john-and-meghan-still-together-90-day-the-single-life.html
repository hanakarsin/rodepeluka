Here's where they might stand today.</p>By <a rel=author href=# class="sc-jhDJkI eZknfg">Chrissy Bobic</a><p class="sc-ensa-Dq fPmIpI">Feb. 12 2024, Updated 9:52 a.m. ET</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Instagram/@ johnnyhandlesticks</a></figure><p>Most <a href=#>90 Day Fiancé</a> fans never thought they'd see the day when <a href=#>John</a>, notorious for being a bachelor and living in his brother Patrick's house, would be ready to settle down. And, even if he still isn't quite there yet, he's coming close with Meghan in Season 4 of <a href=#>90 Day: The Single Life</a>. So, are John and Meghan still together now?</p><p>John reveals in the fourth season premiere that he's dating someone new. He's also living on his own, more or less, and clearly, this is a John that viewers hadn't seen before. He's a far cry from the guy who resented Patrick's wife Thais for judging him for drinking at 10 a.m. He's not a completely changed man, but John has grown up a bit, and it makes fans hopeful that this relationship with Meghan could stick.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TLC</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">Are John and Meghan still together after '90 Day: The Single Life'?</h2><p>There are a couple of things standing in the way of John's own 90 Day Fiancé happily ever after. Meghan lives in another state, which means their relationship is long distance right off the bat. And, she has a child from a previous relationship. John worries if he is ready to be a step-dad, when he never really considered having kids before now.</p><p>And even now on the show, John isn't super into the idea of being with someone who has a kid and who expects him to easily slide into the step-father role. Outside of 90 Day: The Single Life, it seems likely that John and Meghan aren't together. Although John did share some photos with Meghan on Instagram, she isn't tagged in them, which means they don;t follow each other on social media. And if that's the case, then they probably don't work out beyond filming.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by John Mcmanus (@johnnyhandlesticks)</a></p></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">John could be back for Season 5 of '90 Day: The Single Life.'</h2><p>John and Patrick are part of Pillow Talk, and John was a fan favorite when he first appeared on 90 Day Fiancé with Patrick. If John and Meghan aren't dating now, which seems likely, it wouldn't be surprising to see him in another season of The Single Life.</p><p>Some fans even shared on <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">reddit</a> that they think John would be perfect for 90 Day Fiance Season 10 cast member Clayton's sister, Brandi. Both Brandi and John are outspoken and can be a little brash. In the 90 Day Fiancé world, they could work. If John returns for Season 5, and Brandi is part of the cast, they could be a match made in side character heaven in the franchise.</p><p>Watch 90 Day: The Single Life on Mondays at 8 p.m. EST on TLC.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfn7ypuoyapZ1lnZq0qa3NZqqtoZyherW7xp6roZ2iYoZxecOasGasmJp6tLXNoKOeZZyes6Y%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SkyVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
