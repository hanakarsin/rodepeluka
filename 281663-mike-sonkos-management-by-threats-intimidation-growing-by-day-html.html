You have 14 days to show cause why you should not be sacked," Sonko said on Wednesday, August 1 to a shocked Majevda who was sacked in full glare of the public.<p class=align-left>He further cast aspersions on Ogaro who had served under his predecessor Evans Kidero claiming he was among individuals working with Kenya Medical Supplies Agency (KEMSA) to divert drugs to private chemists.</p><p class=align-left>Sonko ordered the official too to stand before a wildly cheering crowd as he lectured him.</p><p class=align-left>As if the incidents were not enough portrayal of arrogance, the governor unsparingly belittled Majevda who had accompanied him during a random visit to Kangemi Health centre which had a shortage of drugs.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/720/0fgjhs4eibkop41q9.jpeg><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO: </strong>MP who stripped in support of Raila loses bid to block Ruto from the presidency</p>"You may be learned as a doctor but I don't care because I am the governor of Nairobi. The people who voted for me must be taken care of. You are blackmailing me through poor service delivery together with your cartels," he accused the CEC.<p class=align-left>The Health Executive had a difficult time explaining there was a shortage of drugs because of payment arrears of over KSh 200 million the county government owed KEMSA, making the latter to cut supplies.</p>"I don't want foolish and mediocre people in my government. We paid KEMSA KSh 52 million and they promised to supply drugs. Even you doctors are operating chemists here to fleece patients. I will sack and close those pharmacies until service delivery improves," Sonko retorted.<p class=align-left>Health Cabinet Secretary Sicily Kariuki was not spared by the governo's arrogance as the Sonko without courtesy, asked her to prevail on KEMSA to resume supplies during the breastfeeding week launch event at Pumwani Maternity Hospital on Thursday, August 2.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/720/0fgjhs6nghsaf9mfr.jpeg><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO: </strong>Except Raila, Uhuru, Ruto and my wife, I fear no one else - Aden Duale</p>"Even you CS whether you listen or not, we need KEMSA to ensure our hospitals have drugs because the debts they are claiming were incurred by Kidero.

Shame is not part of me," the governor retorted.<p class=align-left>Sonko also stormed maternity sections in Kangemi and Pumwani without caring about the privacy of the mothers in a bid to inquire if they had paid for the services or not and even gave some of them cash to buy bleach as directed by nurses.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/720/0fgjhs7vegupg0n8h.jpeg><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO: </strong>Kiambu missing child found with father who wanted to save the baby from mum’s irresponsibility</p><p class=align-left>The governor's theatrics prompted Kariuki to prevail on KEMSA to begin supplying drugs to county hospitals from Friday, August 3.</p>"After quick consultation with my team and as per your request, KEMSA will resume supply of drugs to your county tomorrow.
