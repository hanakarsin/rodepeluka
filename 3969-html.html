It’s up to the law enforcement agents. This is probably the problem of the police. You know, they (Police and SSS) have to secure the country. Constitutionally it’s their job</p><p align=justify>“Boko Haram as I said, I would rather that the police should be empowered.</p><p align=justify>“It’s the police that live with the people- they know in every police command- the neighborhood and so on. A lot of the responsibility I think should go to the police.”</p><p align=justify>The one time military dictator also decried the poor state of the nation’s education system.</p><p align=justify>Buhari said, “Our education has virtually collapsed. How many libraries do we have in the states not to talk about the local governments? People can’t afford to buy books.</p><p align=justify>“Education has deteriorated. If you look around the country, how many people are getting good credits in English language which is the official (language) in the country?”</p><p align=justify>Buhari commended the author for taking off time to put his experiences in writing.</p><p align=justify>He, however, disagreed with the author’s postulations that our problems lie with followership and not the leadership.</p><p align=justify>Earlier, Dr. Chukwuemeka Eziefe said it was in the interest of us all that Nigeria survives.</p><p align=justify>He said, “It is in the interest of all that Nigeria survives. As the largest country in Africa, we have, the destiny to be the greatest. No Boko Haram can stop it.”</p><p>Author of the book, Dr. Chinwoke Mbadinuju, seized the opportunity to dispel the long held belief that schools in Anambra State were closed for one year during his administration.</p><p>Source: Legit.ng</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rbHGoqtnppdkgHqCmGefraWc</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SkyVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
