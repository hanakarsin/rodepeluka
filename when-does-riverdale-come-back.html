Following tonight’s mid-season finale, fans will be left wondering about the fate of our favorite foursome —&nbsp;and when the show will be coming back.&nbsp;</p><p>As expected, fans of the CW series are in denial about the hiatus. "I am so sad that it’s already the midsession finale," one viewer tweeted before another added, "Just as the season is heating up, the show is going on a break...So much is happening, there's a group seizure, we meet Jughead's Mom & sister, Betty is trying to escape & save everyone etc."&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">So, what is the Riverdale midseason premiere date?</h2><p>According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">IMDB</a>, Riverdale will come back on the air on January, 16, 2019. The next episode is titled: Chapter Forty-Four: No Exit. This means fans won't have to wait too long for the show to return to TV screens.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: CW</span></figure><p>In case you need a recap ahead of the finale, Betty &nbsp;(Lili Reinhart) was institutionalized, by her own mother no less, when she would not stop looking into the identity of the Gargoyle King. Her refusal to join her mother and sister’s cult — known as The Farm — and her sleuthing skills, led her mom to locking her away at the Sisters of Quiet Mercy, which is a home for troubled youth. Unbeknownst to her mom (or maybe not), Betty was drugged while at SOQM, and was dragged to meet the Gargoyle King. Yes, the GK even has reign over the all-girls institution.&nbsp;</p><p>It’s also important to remember that it was revealed last episode that Hiram Lodge (Mark Consuelos) is "the man in black,” and has a hand in the school’s illicit activities as well.&nbsp;</p><p>Meanwhile, Archie (KJ Apa) and Jughead (Cole Sprouse) — who are on the run —&nbsp;are seeking shelter while trying to outmaneuver Hiram, who is out for Archie’s blood. Last week’s episode solidified the notion that Mr. Lodge controls the citizens in neighboring towns, and at this point, it feels the infamous twosome can only trust one another.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: CW</span></figure><p>In a last minute decision, Archie revealed to Jughead that he is going to kill his ex-girlfriend’s father. After much convincing, the two hightail it away from their captors, narrowly escaping the clutches of Hiram once again.&nbsp;</p><p>Veronica (Camila Mendes) is currently working hard to keep her speakeasy and Pop’s Chocolate Shop afloat. To help bring in extra income, V decided to partner with one of her father’s shady colleagues’ son. After he tried to get one over on her, Veronica has the last laugh and becomes the swindler. The last minute trick was a tip from her father. Maybe the two aren't so different after all…?&nbsp;</p><p>As the mid-season draws to a close, fans are interested to see how these individual storylines will come together. What does The Farm, the seizures, the Gargoyle King, and Mr. Lodge all have in common? We are certainly hoping to find out the answer tonight.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: CW</span></figure><p>In a sneak peek clip of tonight’s episode, we are met with Betty fighting back from her sick Sister captors. Yes, she even holds a pencil up to one of the Sisters’ throats. Once again, we are living for dark Betty! Veronica and a group of cheerleaders are all seen having a massive seizure in the middle of the Riverdale High hallway. But, what most fans are looking forward to is the reunion between Jughead, his mom, Gladys, and his little sister, Jellybean.&nbsp;</p><p>For the past three seasons, we’ve heard Jughead mention his mom and sister in passing, but have never actually seen the characters. With her son and his best friend in trouble, we wonder if this former Serpent will find her way home.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">When is Riverdale Season 3 coming to Netflix?&nbsp;</h2><p>Obviously, you will have to wait until the season finale to binge-watch Riverdale's latest episodes — so expect them to drop on the streaming platform around May 2019.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Riverdale mid-Season 3 finale predictions:</h2><p>Though spoilers for the show are kept under lock and key, that doesn’t stop fans from wondering what will become of their favorite characters.&nbsp;</p><p>In a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">reddit</a> group, some fans are predicting that Penny Peabody will be killed off the show. Remember Penny? She’s the Ghoulie who has been a pain for Jughead and his Serpent gang. This gang leader has tortured, beaten, and swindled our favorite beanie-wearing hunk. And, with Jughead’s mom back in the picture, we’re sure she won’t appreciate her kid being threatened. Sorry Penny, but your time at Riverdale may be up.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: CW</span></figure><p>Another villain that may make an appearance in the mid-season finale is Betty’s father, and the Blackhood (revealed in Season 2), Hal Cooper. It has been suspected that a bad guy from a previous season will make his or her way back into the drama-filled town of Riverdale.</p><p>Overall, we’re hoping to see the return, and possibly the final demise, of either Hal or Penny on tonight’s episode!</p><p>Be sure to watch Riverdale’s mid-season finale tonight on the CW at 8 p.m. EST — and mark your calendars for Jan. 16, 2019</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaJ2eqbKzwMCipaadnql8c3yQcWZqal9mf3CClHGBqYR7ZMSpsc1mm6ido2K%2FqsLEq5uapJVisLC5xGaZmpub</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SkyVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
