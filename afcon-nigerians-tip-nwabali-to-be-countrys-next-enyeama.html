Nigerian fans are optimistic that the goalkeeper will be fit for the Super Eagles’ quarter-final match against Angola.</p><p><strong>Naija News</strong> reports thatalthough many Nigerians believe that Nwabali’s performance in the current nations cup is remarkable, some argue that he has not yet reached the caliber of the great goaltender Vincent Enyeama. On the other hand, Nigerians predicted the goaltender to follow in the footsteps of “Enyeama.”</p><p>It is thought that Vincent Enyeama, who retired from international football with the Super Eagles in October 2015, is&nbsp;arguably the greatest goalkeeper in Nigerian football history. He had over 13 years of goalkeeping bliss.</p><p>Tipping Nwabali to become Nigeria’s next best goal keeper, @mazi_duce. wrote, “He isn’t at the level of Enyeama yet, but he’s trying and needs to keep pushing.”</p><p>@ToonzPhil wrote, “Honestly speaking… He is him… The stature, style of play (even advance),cos he knows how to play from the back. 80% of his long kicks (vs Cameroon) were complete (osimhen head) which allowed osimhen to hold on play… So to me…. HE IS HIM.”</p><p>On his part, @noblemi6 said that it was too early to make comparison. “It’s too early to compare…. He is trying though but not there yet,” he wrote.</p><p>@Akinjoshua2017 wrote&nbsp; “He should keep up with his performance and yes he can be the enyeama we need.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpkZH1ye5FyZpqek6S7brrIoJyroZGjwG7AyKlkp6%2BRl66ttYytpmaalWKwsMHNramyq12jsrnAjJ6lsp2Roq5w</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SkyVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
